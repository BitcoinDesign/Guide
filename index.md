## We are helping make [bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org) more intuitive and accessible.


As bitcoin’s popularity continues to rise, it is essential that everyone be able to participate in this new economy regardless of technical expertise or geography. That can only happen if creators everywhere have the resources and community necessary to foster better bitcoin experiences.

The Bitcoin Design Community [Slack](http://bitcoindesigners.org) is an open space to discuss and explore everything bitcoin and design. Open standards are part of our foundation, so all of our work can also be found on [Github](https://github.com/BitcoinDesign/Meta).

Everyone is welcome to join and participate.

### The Bitcoin Design Guide

Our first community project, the [Bitcoin Design Guide]({{ '/guide' | relative_url }}) is a free, open-source repository for anyone building non-custodial bitcoin products. The guide will eventually cover consumer wallets, merchant interactions, financial applications, and much more.

If you’d like to help by providing feedback, submitting ideas, or creating content, check out the list of current [issues](https://github.com/BitcoinDesign/Guide/issues) or join us on Slack.
