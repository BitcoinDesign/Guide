### [Why design for Bitcoin]({{ '/guide/designing-products/why-design-for-bitcoin/' | relative_url }})

Bitcoin is fundamentally open and participatory and allows designers and creators to explore and shape experiences for users around the globe.

### [Open design]({{ '/guide/designing-products/open-design/' | relative_url }})

Open design is about global collaboration that balances the free exchange of design information, the independence of individual designers and the collective power of collaboration.

### [User research]({{ '/guide/designing-products/user-research/' | relative_url }})

All products begin with user needs and end in those same users hands. User research is a fundamental activity that helps us focus on things people care about.

---

### [Usage life cycle]({{ '/guide/designing-products/usage-life-cycle/' | relative_url }})

### [Personal finance]({{ '/guide/designing-products/personal-finance/' | relative_url }})

If we consider Bitcoin money, we need to consider how Bitcoin users think about their finances. This page provides a simple framework that can serve as a starting point, deriving bitcoin software and hardware setups from common budgeting categories.

---

### [Common user flows]({{ '/guide/designing-products/common-user-flows/' | relative_url }})

Most Bitcoin applications share certain user activities, from initial setup to making a transaction. It is vital to follow users' expected patterns and behaviors to reduce mistakes and enable seamless switching between products.

---

### [Wallet interoperability]({{ '/guide/designing-products/wallet-interoperability/' | relative_url }})
