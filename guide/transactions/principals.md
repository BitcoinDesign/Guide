# Principals

## Familiarity

Using familiar patterns and analogies we can allow new users to begin interacting faster, and gradually grow their bitcoin knowledge — not having to learn too many things upfront and risk being overwhelmed and eventually give up before they even start.

## Empathy

- User is educated through the software, so they can slowly develop confidence by gaining experience.
- Be against dumbing things down, instead aim to make bitcoin understandable.
- Grow with the user. Not everyone is an expert, and even experts at one point in time are beginners.

## Truthfulness

Be truthful to bitcoin.

You are not given privacy when interacting onchain — the perception of this could lead to bad consequences for users who are unaware and require such.

Be true to the principals of bitcoin and display that honestly. Be truthful to the user. They should know they are using bitcoin, but not distracted by it when they need to complete a task.

- *e.g. of not being truthful. Most wallets have a total balance and you spend out of the balance, but thats not how bitcoin works.*
- Help users learn what a UTXO is, not imediatly but over time.
- Give them choice.

## Consistency

Create a consistent visual language for similar objects, especially in the case when new concepts are being introduced to the user (*e.g. UTXOs*).
