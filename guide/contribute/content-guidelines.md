# Content guidelines

The Bitcoin Design Guide is the work of many authors with different backgrounds, each with their own unique voice and perspective. To help us ensure a consistent written voice throughout the guide, follow these content guidelines.

#### Know your reader

This guide was created specifically for designers who work on open-source, non-custodial bitcoin projects. It isn't the biggest audience in design, but it is among the most specialized. Read more in-depth about the [Target audience]({{ '/guide/target-audience' | relative_url }})..

#### Speak to the reader

Address the reader directly. Use active instead of passive voice. Make reader a part the conversation by using second-person pronouns like "you," "your," and "yours". Do not write in first-person and avoid giving predictions and personal opinions.

#### Use simple language

Bitcoin is a global currency, so not everyone using this guide will be a native English speaker. Make sure you are writing in plain, easy to follow English. If you're still not sure, try using a readability tool to analyze your text and make recommendations. We like [Hemingway](http://www.hemingwayapp.com).

#### Be concise

Focus on information relevant to the reader. Use direct, clear, concise sentences that are easy to understand. Try to reduce the word count to just the right brevity without being obscure.

#### Make content scannable

On the internet, majority of people scans the content before reading it. By scanning, a reader tries to search for a relevant information on the page.
Split text into paragraphs, use links, text styling and images to enhance the scanability. Per paragraph you should have 3-4 sentences.

#### Linking

Linking provides necessary context and helps with information repetition. Link to the [Glossary]({{ '/guide/glossary' | relative_url }}) or to another page in the guide whenever possible. If information isn't available, consider linking to a reputable third-party resource.

#### Give tips, not commands

When giving instruction, stick to broad strokes. They can be adjusted over time to grow with a project and its designer. Overly detailed instructions are usually outdated by the next software patch.  

#### Get the reader involved

The Design Guide is a set of recommended solutions and practices based on our research that should encourage self-sufficient thinking and creativity. Motivate people to think critically and inspire them to come up with their 
#### Show, donâ€™t tell

Feel free to reference other software using screenshots. Remember to indicate the product and version. Focus on what you like about them instead of what you don't like.

#### Use the right medium

A picture is worth a thousand words, but so are videos, interactive prototypes, diagrams, and more. Don't be afraid to try a different medium if you think it will inform better than text or a picture.

#### Be humble

The guide is a work in progress and needs to evolve to stay relevant. What we write today may not be applicable tomorrow. Have fun. Don't overthink things. Bitcoin, and therefore this guide, is the ultimate work-in-progress.

#### Write in the open

It's a good idea to ask for directions by seeking feedback early. This may stop you from wandering too far in the wrong direction. There is a whole community around you that's ready to jump in and help.
