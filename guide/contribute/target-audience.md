# Who are we writing the Bitcoin design guide for?

[INTO PARAGRAPH GOES HERE]

- Designer
- Project manager
- Developer
- Bitcoiner

## The designer
[INTRO PARAGRAPH NEDDED HERE]

*The designers are our main audience for the design guide.
Who they are and what they know (and donâ€™t know) There are also few designers in the space, and they struggle to wrap their heads around the topic. They may be the least incentivized and have the highest barriers to learn and figure things out.*

### Scenarios

- Trained designer who was worked in an agency before and is now starting work on a Bitcoin product
- A passionate designer without formal training or experience and is helping out an open-source bitcoin product
- Trained designer with an idea for a product who wants to quickly prototype a somewhat realistic application (could be for a client project, a designathon, a Dribbble shot, etc)
- A designer who is interested in open design and is looking for a project to help out with (differentiate between major involvement vs helping out occasionally)

### Solutions

- Explain why bitcoin matters and how it works without getting into a ton of technical detail
- Help navigate open source and open design
- Showcase great products and concepts
- Provide specific approaches and resources to help in day-to-day work
- Provide design resources (UI Kit)

## The developer
[INTRO PARAGRAPH NEDDED HERE]

### Prior knowledge

- Has a deep understanding of the protocol and apis
- Has started building solo and lacks design resources
- Is not sure which patterns are good or bad for ux
- Is trying to create a new experience and has no design references

### Scenarios

- Solo developer starting their own project
- Open source developer wanting to understand ux implications of their PR
- Open source developer wanting to justify their design decisions to other contributors
- Developer with a product idea but self funded and lacks design resources
- Developer with a bit of design experience

### Solutions

- UI Kit / flexible solutions that can be mixed and matched
- Design & technical foundations of bitcoin to help onboard a non bitcoin designer to their team
- Design Patterns / Understand ux tradeoffs of patterns they are considering to implement
- Use Cases / Gain wider perspectives on user archetypes and stages of learning they go through

## The product manager
[INTRO PARAGRAPH NEDDED HERE]

### Scenarios
