There’s never really been an easy, let alone fun, way to get people engaged with bitcoin tech. That was until [Saving Satoshi](http://savingsatoshi.com).

Saving Satoshi is an interactive role-playing game (RPG) that uses storytelling and game mechanics to onboard curious coders into bitcoin tech and the BOSS (bitcoin open source software) ecosystem. With fun, innovative challenges and exercises, it’s designed to be a gentle and welcoming entry point for those that wish to go deeper into the world of bitcoin development. From address derivation to block template construction, players are introduced to a variety of technical topics over the course of ten chapters, each filled to the brim with challenges, simulations, and interactive coding exercises. Beginning with basic concepts like hashing and using a block explorer, learners quickly advance to more difficult challenges, ultimately culminating in the lightning network.

This unique learning experience is told as a sci-fi epic set in a hyperbitcoinized future. The year is 2139, and the entire bitcoin network has come to a halt. It is up to the player to figure out what is going on and to ultimately save bitcoin. Luckily the player is not in this alone as a holographic cat, Holocat, delivers messages and clues from “Satoshi” to help with the quest. Through the story, various aspects of bitcoin culture are communicated, which complement the more technical learning material.

## The ambition

Bitcoin is serious, but learning about it doesn’t have to be. There aren’t many bitcoin projects that subscribe to this philosophy. The team dreamed of something they wanted to exist and decided to build it. Saving Satoshi strives to make technical bitcoin education more fun and accessible while complementing, not replacing, the excellent resources that are around today. When it comes time to sit down and learn something new there can sometimes be emotional barriers that come up. By adding a playful spin, projects like Saving Satoshi can function as a gentle and welcoming entry point for people that may feel overwhelmed or intimidated. Even better, this lighthearted approach allows for the integration of culture, design, and other elements that are as captivating as the technology itself. 

The team strongly feels that bitcoin is a positive force in the world, and wants to see more bitcoiners and bitcoin devs. Understanding bitcoin from a technical standpoint, even just the basics, is often the main step to deeper involvement. With more contributors, bitcoin can grow stronger, no matter what challenges it faces. 

This project is also driven by personal reasons. There is an enjoyment to be had from the creative challenge of putting something unique and innovative into the world. Educators get to experiment and iterate on the developer learning experience. Designers get to play with storytelling and generative AI. Engineers get to uncover new or forgotten details about bitcoin tech.

## Origin story

In October 2022, the Bitcoin Design Community organized its first [Designathon](http://event.bitcoin.design), in collaboration with the first Bolt.fun Legends of Lightning hackathon. Adam Jonas, of [Chaincode](http://chaincode.com), proposed the idea of Saving Satoshi, which is very close to what the project came to be today. Take a look back in [this recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5Fw0HIqZDM) of the first call the group had together.

Christoph, who helped organize the Designathon, simply meant to help out and get the project off the ground while Jonas was traveling for a few days. Little did he know that he would lead the design for the next two+ years.

Several developers joined the project to evaluate various technical approaches and start building the first prototypes and proof-of-concepts. This initial effort paid off, and the project [won the award](https://boltfun.substack.com/i/89248284/saving-satoshi) for Best Design in the Global Adoption Track.

## Progress

Excited about the positive response, the team continued building. In December 2023, about a year later, the team reached a half-way point with the [completion of the first five chapters](https://stacker.news/items/348567?commentId=350898). The [submission video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW6tmJMNc5g) for the second Legends of Lightning hackathon is a good overview of the project at the time.

In the fall of 2024, as the project was nearing completion, a first workshop was organized at [TABConf](https://6.tabconf.com) in Atlanta. It was a great way to get a good part of the core team together, while also getting feedback on the experience.

In December 2024, eager to get Saving Satoshi in front of more learners, the team wrapped up chapters 9 and 10 and [officially launched](https://x.com/Bitcoin_Devs/status/1863990282372669626) the project.

There have been many contributors to the project over the course of its development. A small core team has provided continuity, and others have helped out in many different ways. Roughly speaking, there are five work groups:

1. [Learning content](#1-learning-content)
2. [Story](#2-story)
3. [Design](#3-design)
4. [Development](#4-development)
5. [User testing](#5-user-testing)

## 1. Learning content

Bitcoin has no shortage of rabbit holes, and the game’s educational content is reflective of this. Players are exposed to a variety of bitcoin tech including:

- Finding and decoding the secret message in the genesis block  
- Hash functions and proof-of-work  
- The dynamics of pooled mining  
- The basics of elliptic curve cryptography and how to derive an address from public-private key pairs  
- ECDSA message signing and verification  
- Building a transaction from scratch  
- Assembling transactions to construct a block template  
- Using the Bitcoin Core RPC API and calculating the block subsidy  
- Bitcoin Script  
- How the lightning network works

Some subjects, like the basics of elliptic curve cryptography, can be difficult to understand with traditional forms of learning like books and white papers. Having said that, Saving Satoshi is not designed to compete with these resources, rather its goal is to complement them. It offers players yet another way to approach bitcoin tech, one with a higher level of interactivity and visuals, and where learning drives a story forward.

**Moving a story forward**  
Players will find that the exercises they are asked to complete go hand in hand with the narrative. One example can be found in chapter 5 where the villain, Thomas Vanderpoole claims to be the great-grandson of Satoshi Nakamoto. Users learn that if this claim is indeed true, Vanderpoole should have no problem producing a digital signature with one of Satoshi’s keys. The game guides the player through an adventure that begins with reading an old message from Hal Finney on the Bitcoin Talk forum. That information is then used to find one of Satoshi’s public keys in the blockchain. Following that, users dive into the specifics of the ECDSA message signing and verification algorithm used in Bitcoin Core before executing the code themselves to figure out if Vanderpoole is really telling the truth.

**Leveraging history to build strong foundations**  
While some of the topics covered in Saving Satoshi involve concepts used less commonly today, it can be beneficial to understand how things got to where they are now. With simple, straightforward examples, players build solid foundations before layering on the complexity. In many cases, this is similar to the natural trajectory of the technology a chapter is focused on.

Take addresses that correspond to public keys as an example. While we now have more advanced address types that involve scripts and other elements of a transaction, it’s still common to see P2WPKH, and even P2PKH addresses in block explorers, wallet software, and documentation. In Saving Satoshi, players first master public-private key cryptography and address derivation with these types of addresses before moving onto more advanced topics like bitcoin script. Attempting to learn everything at once would be too overwhelming.

The bitcoin industry deliberately moves at a pace that is slow and steady. Many software projects do not use the latest and greatest technology until it has been battle tested. Even when it comes time for a product to move to a newer solution, it can often take a while, especially if a large user base will be impacted. For that reason, we believe that learning about the history of a technology and what it has looked like in previous iterations is time well spent.

**Using design to help address the tension between simplicity and accuracy**  
When developing educational material, especially for bitcoin, there is often an inherent tension between creating something easy to understand and something that is technically accurate. To tackle this challenge, the team had to get creative and expand on the ways that the game communicates and interacts with users. Design played a critical role in this, unlocking new ways of thinking so that more learning material can be presented to the user without overwhelming them.

Some places where this can be seen are:

- Chapter 2: Real time hashing driven by user input to demonstrate proof-of-work  
- Chapter 3: Simulations to show the dynamics of pooled mining and 51% attacks  
- Chapter 5: Color coding a raw transaction hex dump to see all the different parts  
- Chapter 8: Visuals to illustrate how a blockchain is similar to a tree like data structure  
- Chapter 9: A drag’n’drop coding interface for script building and evaluation  
- Chapter 10: Gamifying the process of opening up a lightning channel with an untrusted counterparty

Despite all the benefits that design delivers to the user experience, it is still of the utmost importance  that every lesson goes through an in-depth review process. Every exercise has been thoroughly tested countless times by a number of contributors, including Bitcoin Core and lightning protocol developers.

**Made with educators in mind**  
Saving Satoshi offers many exciting opportunities for educators seeking to integrate bitcoin into their programs. While the game has plenty of material for a curriculum that stands on its own, each chapter is full of additional resources and links for those looking to dive deeper. By accident, the game itself actually follows a difficulty arc where chapters 1-3 are easy before things are kicked up a notch in later chapters. At the time of this writing, chapter 6 supports two difficulty modes, normal and hard. A long term goal is to extend this to the rest of the game so Saving Satoshi can serve a wider audience without compromising on the quality of learning.

It’s also ideal for learning with friends. In October 2024 the first Saving Satoshi workshop was held at TABConf in Atlanta, GA. Over fifty participants joined to play together and work through the challenges. Prizes were given to all players and many continued playing after leaving the workshop.

One early educational partner and supporter for Saving Satoshi has been Scalar School. They host nightly sessions where participants get together on Discord to play the game.

## 2. Story

**Building a story around the words “Saving Satoshi”**  
Most stories are born from an idea. Few begin with just a title, and that is for good reason. Any writer will tell you that crafting a game’s entire storyline around a cool sounding phrase isn’t the best idea. Reason being it’s difficult to work backwards and create an engaging, cohesive tale that leads to a very specific ending. Fortunately for Jonas who came up with the phrase “Saving Satoshi”, and unfortunately for our lead storywriter, the name “Saving Satoshi” was quickly set in stone due to a lack of writers during the early stages of the project. Thanks to this unusual decision, the Saving Satoshi storyline experienced no shortage or hurdles.

Going back to the first brainstorming sessions, it was established that the game was going to be set in the future against some kind of sci-fi epic. It only made sense to have things begin with a historic event for bitcoin that has yet to happen. That event is the mining of the last satoshi, something that is sure to go down in history. Making this the focal point of chapter one was straightforward and since that chapter was just for a hackathon, there wasn’t any pressure to think about how a story like this may end.

Things quickly ramped up as work on chapters 2 and 3 began. It’s hard to write a story one chapter at a time, especially when it’s unclear where it’s all going. That’s when the team was fortunate enough to get help from Spiral in the form of one very talented lead storywriter that is rumored to actually be four cats behind a keyboard. With their help, a sketch started to form of what the full story would look like beyond chapter 2. It was known that the game would end on a high note, with a sense of accomplishment in that the player really did “save Satoshi”--even if “Satoshi” was more about the spirit that bitcoin was created on, and not the literal creator. That was the only story requirement. Everything else was fair game.

**The plot thickens**  
Before long, ideas started flowing. The Thomas Vanderpoole character, an antagonist initially named Dr. Greg B.S. Wrong, began to form. For the lead storywriter, it was important that Vanderpoole was not 100% evil villain and for him to have some humanizing qualities. Even better was if he could have a redemption arc. Players will see that as they learn more about Vanderpoole’s background and personal connection to bitcoin, they are better able to understand his actions, as disruptive to the bitcoin network as they may be.

Another gem of that came out of this phase of story writing was Holocat, a holographic cat that delivers clues and messages to the player. It took no time for her to earn her status as a fan favorite, both internally and with players outside of the team. However all these new characters and ideas brought a big challenge. How could they all fit together and form a story that made sense? As if that wasn’t difficult enough, the next question was how could the story be shaped around lesson content? Both tasks proved to be quite difficult but fortunately only a few chapters had lesson content already scoped. For later chapters, changes were made to the process so lesson content and the story could be developed in partnership with each other.  
   
**The final review**  
The story was able to move at a considerably faster pace than development and after many months, it was done in spring 2023. However, the *story* doesn’t end there. Fast forward a year and a half later to late summer 2024 when the final chapters of Saving Satoshi were under development. That’s when the story underwent a final review. This review took several months to complete as it contained a countless amount of edits and updates.

While there weren’t any major changes to the plot, this final revision resulted in many smaller updates and one complete character redesign. User testing revealed that players wanted a more interesting character so after many rejected name proposals like Jessica Soup, Mike Ramen was replaced with Mika 3000.

%}

A number of plot holes were also addressed at this time, some that had been there since the very beginning. These were cans that could no longer be kicked down the road, calling for deep collaboration between writers and bitcoin tech experts. Care had to be put into making sure the scenarios that were being created were not only technically sound, but that they still drove the story forward in a meaningful way. Many things were hashed out over phone calls and long comment threads. 

**World building**  
An especially fun part of story writing was creating a universe unique to the game. The team had fun reciting Holocat’s sassy one liners, imagining what a ButtLift Hover Desk would look like, and agreeing that no one would ever think to look for Satoshi’s keys on a CD-ROM labeled *Creed – My Own Prison*. 

The universe really came to life at the first Saving Satoshi workshop where swag was created to represent different elements of the game like logos for the mining groups featured in chapter 3 and holographic Holocat stickers.

   caption = "Swag created for the TABConf 2024 workshop."

   height = 503
   layout = "full-width"
%}

While there were a number of things that didn’t make it into the final cut of the story these ideas have been saved for later releases. Look forward to a list of bitcoin themed cocktail drinks and much more in a future update!

**Incorporating bitcoin culture and history**  
The story provided a unique opportunity to incorporate bits of bitcoin culture and history that not only enriched the overall game, but also balanced out some of the more heavy technical material. Normally one would have to go to Twitter or Reddit to learn more about these topics, so it was great to be able to transmit this kind of information in a different way. Saving Satoshi is built by a team passionate about bitcoin. Bringing some bitcoin culture and history into the game was one more way to express that love.

Examples of this can be found all over the game. From the very start in chapter 1, players find the secret message in the genesis block (“The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks”). The phrase “Thomas Vanderpoole is not Satoshi”, a dig on the infamous Craig Wright lawsuits, can be found on Saving Satoshi tees and stickers. At several points in the game “don’t trust, verify” is taken quite literally like chapter 8 when users compute block subsidies and check that the longest chain adheres to the rules. When bitcoin script is introduced in chapter 9 Holocat delivers a message about the `OP_CHECKMULTISIG` bug in Satoshi’s code that pops an extra item off the stack. In chapter 10 players meet a character named Laszlo, a nod to the famous Laszlo Hanyecz who bought two pizzas for 10,000 bitcoin in 2010. Even the spirit of the game, one where the protagonist can be anybody but still save bitcoin, echoes the popular saying, “We are all Satoshi”.

## 3. Design

The blending of story and education resulted in some unique design challenges.

An early ambition was to illustrate the story via generative AI. In late 2022, broadly available tools were more rudimentary. The hands in generated images often had 6 fingers, characters were inconsistent, there was little control over composition, resolutions were limited, etc. The team still committed to this direction, expecting to iterate as the technology progresses. This strategy worked out well, and visual storytelling has made huge strides.

   alt-text = ""
   caption = "Consistent rendering of characters and environments allowed for more precise storytelling."
   width = 800
   height = 500
   layout = "full-width"
%}

A second challenge was to create a learning experience that started gentle, and could slowly guide users towards more complex material and tasks. Each chapter was designed separately, carefully considering the lesson content, while also keeping in mind the other chapters for consistency and continuity. The whole team helped shape the user experience, and it was often the developers who gave important direction, since they are close to the target audience and understand the subject matter the best.

Plus, Christoph created [various recordings](https://www.youtube.com/@germanysbestkeptsecret/search?query=saving%20satoshi) of the design process.

## 4. Development

A big challenge in development has been thinking about incrementing difficulty and faithfulness to the realistic logic of bitcoin code.

We found creating new and unique components important to keeping the experience interesting while trying to keep development time as low as possible.

Lastly is in creating an educational platform we have been trying to create as much ease of contribution for new devs. While we are not directly a bitcoin app or program, we are a touch point for a lot of new developers and making sure that we allow those new devs a positive experience in their first contributions.

## 5. User testing

We collected feedback from users using several methods throughout the project. 

### Feedback Form

First, we had a user feedback form that was linked from the “Help” section in the game. This led to a Google Forms questionnaire with a set of questions that users can fill out. 

### Early Feedback

Second, we would offer open invitations to bitcoin devs to try it out and share their reflections with us. After giving Saving Satoshi a go, we’d have the user join our weekly product team calls and share out loud what stood out to them, what they liked, and what they’d want to see done differently. 

### Moderated User Tests

Third, we carried out more formal moderated user tests. This took the form of a structured interview led by a product researcher like Art or Andrew. In the beginning, we defined broad personas for the game and invited them to recorded virtual interviews: 

1. Beginner developer with 1 year of experience with little to no experience working on bitcoin  
2. Senior developer with little to no experience working on bitcoin  
3. Experienced bitcoin developer

The scope was to test only one chapter per interview and attempted to avoid influencing them by asking open-ended questions and quietly observing how they completed the challenges.

We also tested a variety of hypotheses across the verticals of demographics, UI, UX, and lesson content such as:

- Demographics: This game would be engaging enough for Senior Developers to continue playing the game.  
- UI: Tooltip pop-ups triggered by a hovering mouse are intuitive.  
- UX: This clue that appeared after three failed challenge attempts will help the user move on to the next step.  
- Lesson content: This topic and challenge won’t be too difficult for a beginner developers.

These interviews were then summarized and shared with the team.

### In-Person Feedback

Fourth, we obtained mass feedback from events such as TABConf. During TABConf we led a workshop where nearly 50 people played the game at the same time. All the while, the product team was there to answer questions, address concerns, and gather feedback. 

### Dog-fooding

Lastly, the product team that built this game also happened to be the kind of user that we’re building it for. So by replaying the game on our own, we provided ongoing, iterative feedback to each other about what delighted and frustrated. 

All in all, the product team had several different sources of data and feedback about Saving Satoshi. We used this ongoing to inform features and ideas. 

## What’s next

Chapter 10 may be a major milestone for Saving Satoshi, but the project is far from over! There are many things the team would like to see in future releases. From design, to learning content, to community, these ideas are not confined to just one aspect of the project and instead span across many facets of the game.

**Difficulty levels**  
One of the larger items on the to-do list is support for different levels of difficulty. In an ideal world, Saving Satoshi would be able to accommodate learners at many levels. Currently, a solid understanding of how to code is a major requirement for finishing the game. However, it would be nice to one day support people that are new to coding and just getting started. Conversely, it would also be great to make advanced exercises for those looking for more of a challenge. This has been implemented to some degree moving certain hints to a separate help page, but there is so much more that can be done. At the moment, chapter 6 supports two difficulty modes (normal and hard). This was initially implemented as a proof-of-concept and the team looks forward to extending this functionality to other chapters.

**Movie trailer**  
On the design and marketing front, a big dream is to do a movie trailer and poster. When the project first began, the AI image and video generation tools were nowhere near where they had to be to support something like this. A lot has changed in the last two years! Even just over the last few months, the design team has made some very impressive short clips to demonstrate what is possible with the technology today. It’s only going to get better and as it does, the possibility of a movie trailer becomes more likely.

**Community involvement**  
In terms of community, the team would like to put more effort towards tapping into the larger bitcoin and software engineering ecosystems to share the game and partner with neighboring groups. More educator tools like a guide for individuals that want to run Saving Satoshi workshops or a comprehensive list of topics that the game covers would help with this initiative. 

**Puzzles and interactive content**  
The team would like to continue exploring ways to make learning bitcoin tech fun, specifically through more interactive, puzzle-like exercises. This has always been one of the project’s goals and it’s one where there is always room for more ideas. The hope is that now that version 1 of the game is out, there is bandwidth to iterate on some chapters and find additional ways to engage with the player on certain learning topics.

## Conclusion

By design, Saving Satoshi is reflective of the best parts of bitcoin. It has endless rabbit holes. It’s not only a cultural transmission in itself, but it also brings forth a rich and vibrant culture of its own. It’s permissionless and makes players think in ways that they may not be used to. It’s 100% open source and built by a passionate group of people under the highest standards. It’s by the people, for the people.

It’s a labor of love.
