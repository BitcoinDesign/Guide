# Automatic cloud backup

## How it works

The user's wallet recovery data and channel states are backed up on their respective cloud storage provider. The [recovery phrase]({{ '/guide/glossary/#recovery-phrase' | relative_url }}) only needs to be backed up once. However, channel states may need to be backed up frequently because they change every time the user’s wallet sends, receives, or routes a payment; therefore, the channel state should be backed up automatically.

If the user's device is lost, stolen, or broken, they can use the backup from their cloud storage account (such as Apple iCloud or Google Drive) to regain access to their funds. To learn more about the technical details, hop over to the [private key management]({{ '/guide/private-key-management/introduction' | relative_url }}) section on this topic.

This method provides users with the feeling that they can rely on their cloud provider to regain access to their funds rather than putting the responsibility entirely on themselves. It also significantly reduces friction during onboarding.

Below is what this wallet's automatic cloud backup user interface looks like.

### How to explain it

This wallet prompts the user to backup as soon as they have received funds in their wallet for the first time. This is a great time to remind the user because they now have a financial incentive to backup this wallet.  Many users may skip the backup during their [first use]({{'/guide/daily-spending-wallet/first-use/' | relative_url}}). This is fine, as they may simply want to try out the wallet and see if it has the features they want before fully committing to using it. But in the event they do skip the backup, it's important to remind them about the backup later, especially once it contains funds.

The wallet explains to the user that their backup is stored on the cloud, and that they can regain access to their funds on another device using their respective cloud account and bitcoin wallet app. The app also explains that if somebody else gains access to your cloud account information, they can also gain access to your funds.

{% include tip/open.html color="green" icon="check" label="Do: Inform your Users" %}

Before creating a wallet backup via cloud backup, make sure the user knows what they are about to do. Once the backup is complete, provide a summary and some reassurances before moving on. Let them know where in their cloud storage they can find their backup. This is a good place for loading interactions and animation because there will likely be a few seconds between when a user clicks to upload to the cloud provider and when it completes.

{% include tip/close.html %}

### Tradeoffs

By not making users manually backup, you decrease the risk of self-inflicted loss of funds. Automatic cloud backups put less pressure and responsibility on the user.

While this is an easier way for users to set up a wallet, it brings in the potential threat of malicious third-party access. If a user's cloud account is hacked, their funds could be compromised. This can be mitigated by encrypting the wallet recovery data before sending it to the cloud provider. However, the user could still lose access to funds if they forget their cloud login information or the cloud provider blocks their access.

By bringing cloud storage providers into the equation, we assume that users trust their providers. This also raises the question of [decentralization]({{ 'guide/getting-started/principles/#decentralization' | relative_url }}), a guiding principle of the bitcoin space, and could be considered in conflict with the popular saying, “not your keys, not your coins.”

{% include tip/open.html color="red" icon="forbid" label="Don’t: Use for High Value Amounts" %}

Automatic cloud backups should not be considered for products with users that are storing high-value amounts. This is because there are potentially more security threat vectors. Instead, consider a [manual backup]({{'/guide/daily-spending-wallet/backup-and-recovery/manual-backup/' | relative_url}}) or using a multi-sig solution like the [Savings wallet]({{'/guide/savings-wallet/' | relative_url}}).

{% include tip/close.html %}

To grant users some ownership of their wallet data, you can create an optional manual backup within the settings menu. A great way to do this is by framing it as an extra layer of security or a good alternative in case the user loses access to their cloud account or feels uncomfortable trusting their cloud provider.
