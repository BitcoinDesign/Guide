# Daily spending wallet

The daily spending wallet is an app designed to quickly and easily send small amounts of bitcoin. It focuses on the following:

## What is a reference design?

A reference design is a complete design for a bitcoin product. It goes beyond just demonstrating individual user flows -- rather, it shows you how all of the user flows fit together and serve a purpose in the user’s life. You can use this open-source reference design to help you build your own similar bitcoin product!

## What we are building

Imagine a product that tries to solve the problem of quickly and easily [sending smaller amounts of bitcoin]({{'/guide/designing-products/personal-finance/#day-to-day-spending' | relative_url}}) to friends and family or paying for small purchases. Ease and speed of use will be important as usage will likely be on mobile devices and on the go. Users are not expected to be well-versed in bitcoin technology or advanced [private key management]({{'/guide/how-it-works/private-key-management/introduction/' | relative_url}}), making it reasonable to worry more about self-inflicted loss than theft.

Since it’s designed for ease, this wallet abstracts away channel management for the user. It can do this by integrating with a [lightning service provider (LSP)]({{'/guide/how-it-works/lightning-services/' | relative_url}}). This way, the user never has to consider their [lightning channels.]({{'/guide/how-it-works/liquidity/' |relative_url}})

Speed of use is important for this wallet. As such, this wallet maintains a single lightning balance. This means that all the user’s funds are quickly spendable over lightning. The wallet uses submarine swaps so the user can send and receive bitcoin on-chain when needed.

### See it in action

Below is a prototype of the daily spending wallet, which outlines a few of the paths a user could take through this app. Click through to get a sense of the actual end-user experience.

You can find the prototype source files on [Figma community](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1186631213810803207), and a direct link to the design file [here](https://www.figma.com/file/lf2Xyw2I2OXPsHiFQVQdiG/Daily-spending-wallet-prototype?node-id=4167%3A92515). There are also some [code resources]({{ '/guide/resources/code-resources/' | relative_url }}) available, such as UI libraries and example wallet builds.

### Alternate Options

The chapters below will walk you through the different sections of this example product and help you understand the design considerations for why this product is built this way.

In the interest of being a fully realized product, this reference design makes assumptions about technologies, specifications, and the kind of person we’re building this for. As you build your own bitcoin product, you may decide that you need to build things differently.

We try to highlight other design approaches throughout and discuss their pros and cons. Look out for “alternate options” as you read. Think of these as building blocks you can swap in and out of this reference design as you plan out your own bitcoin product.

### [Backup & recovery]({{ '/guide/daily-spending-wallet/backup-and-recovery/landing-page/' | relative_url }})

As a self-custodial wallet, this app places control of the private key in the hands of the user. To make this easier, it provides an easy [automatic cloud backup]({{'/guide/daily-spending-wallet/backup-and-recovery/cloud-backup/' | relative_url}}) option. Users may opt to perform a [manual backup]({{'/guide/daily-spending-wallet/backup-and-recovery/manual-backup/' | relative_url}}) instead or in addition. This app has [recovery]({{'/guide/daily-spending-wallet/backup-and-recovery/recovery/' | relative_url}}) flows that guide the user in restoring access to their wallet.

### [Requesting]({{ '/guide/daily-spending-wallet/requesting/' | relative_url }})

This wallet lets the user quickly request bitcoin directly from the app's home screen. From there, the user can edit associated metadata and share the payment request in a variety of ways.

%}

### [Activity]({{ '/guide/daily-spending-wallet/activity/' | relative_url }})

For an app the user may rely on daily, transaction history is more than just a list of amounts and fees. This wallet helps the user capture the meaning behind their transaction history with the activity screen. Smart organization, tags, and searching are just a few of the features that make this data useful to the user.
