Alice and Bob have been using their savings wallet for a couple of years now and everything has worked smoothly so far. On this page we will take a look at what happens if they need to make changes to their setup. If users are storing bitcoin over a long enough period of time, there are a couple of scenarios that they might run into: 

1. They need to replace a key that has been lost.
2. They want to change the basic wallet configuration.

### How it works

When users need to make changes to their multisig wallet, such as replacing a key or modifying the wallet configuration, the process involves creating a new wallet and transferring funds. Here's how the process works from Bob's and Alice's perspective:

1. Bob makes the desired changes, which creates a new wallet.
1. He shares the new wallet with Alice for setup in her application.
1. Bob and Alice activate the new wallet on all three primary signing devices. 
1. They save and store the new wallet recovery kit as described in the [backup page]({{ '/guide/inheritance-wallet/backup/#backup-strategy' | relative_url }}).
1. Transfer all funds to the new wallet.
1. Archive the old wallet to manage any future incoming funds.


## Replacing David's signing key

Let's assume that David, one of the heirs, has lost his signing device. Fortunately, it is part of the inheritance key set, which is restricted by a timelock, as we have covered [here]({{ '/guide/inheritance-wallet/wallet-creation/#creating-the-inheritance-key-set' | relative_url }}). Although David still has his seed phrase backup, the Joneses decide to replace David's key as a precautionary measure. They would follow the same approach if David had lost the seed phrase backup or suspected it had been compromised.

#### Adding the new key

After David received the new signing device, he exports the extendend public key (XPUB), just like he did during the [wallet creation]({{ '/guide/inheritance-wallet/wallet-creation/#adding-the-inheritance-keys' | relative_url }}) process. He then shares it with his parents via a shared chat on Signal. 

The prototype below lets you click through the key replacement flow:

{% include prototype.html
   link = "https://www.figma.com/proto/h5GP5v5dYfpXXfEUXf6nvC/Inheritance-wallet?page-id=6295%3A8715&type=design&node-id=6466-13302&viewport=337%2C-87%2C0.17&t=ctQmwe5HnelSERog-1&scaling=min-zoom&starting-point-node-id=6466%3A13302&show-proto-sidebar=1&mode=design"
   image = "/assets/images/guide/inheritance-wallet/making-changes/key-replacement/prototype-key-replacement.jpg"
   retina = "/assets/images/guide/inheritance-wallet/making-changes/key-replacement/prototype-key-replacement@2x.jpg"
   mobile = "/assets/images/guide/inheritance-wallet/making-changes/key-replacement/prototype-key-replacement-mobile.jpg"
   mobileRetina = "/assets/images/guide/inheritance-wallet/making-changes/key-replacement/prototype-key-replacement-mobile@2x.jpg"
   alt-text = "An image showing couple of reference screens from the prototype"
   width = 800
   height = 500
%}

Once he receives David's XPUB, Bob opens our application and navigates to the wallet settings. On the wallet settings page, Bob goes the signing keys page. From there the app guides him through the key replacement flow. It starts with a short explanation dialog that outlines how the process works.   

{% include image-gallery.html pages = page.images_key-replacement-configuration %} 

The app then asks which of the keys Bob would like to replace. Bob selects David's Passport from the list of keys. On the next screen, the app gives Bob the option to change the wallet configuration as well. But he only needs to replace David's key, so he continues with the same configuration. He does, however, choose a different name for the new wallet.

The next step is to add David's new extended public key. This works in the same way as during the initial wallet creation. On the wallet review screen, the app indicates that a new signing key has been added. Bob reviews the changes and hits "create wallet."

{% include image-gallery.html pages = page.images_key-replacement-add-key %}

### Cosigner setup, device activation and wallet backup 

The new inheritance wallet is now created. Just like during the initial wallet creation, Alice and Bob now need to:

1. Share the wallet configuration with Alice, so that she can set up the wallet on her app.
1. Activate the new wallet on all of their signing devices.
1. Save the backup kit for the new wallet.

We have covered these topics in the previous pages of this reference design.

### Moving funds to the new wallet

Now that the new wallet is ready, Alice and Bob need to transfer their savings to this new wallet. Again, our app shows this in the form of a reminder. 

#### Bob creates and signs the transaction

Bob taps on the reminder and initiates the transaction creation process. Because the app is aware of both wallets, it can prefill most of the information in the send flow, such as the recipient address and the transaction amount. After creating the transaction, Bob signs it with his Trezor right away.

{% include image-gallery.html pages = page.images_fund-transfer-bob %} 

The transaction is now ready for Alice to sign as well. However, there is no central server coordinating or automatically syncing transaction information between Bob and Alice's devices, because our app aims to work in the most [self-custodial way]({{ '/guide/inheritance-wallet/overview/#role-of-the-wallet-provider' | relative_url }}) possible. 

This means that Bob has to manually share the [partially signed bitcoin transaction]({{ '/guide/glossary/#partially-signed-bitcoin-transaction-psbt' | relative_url }}) (PSBT) with Alice. Our app offers a variety of different sharing options. Bob chooses to generate a QR code, so that Alice can scan it conveniently.

#### Alice co-signs the transaction

Alice opens the wallet app on her phone, selects the family savings wallet and hits send. In the send sheet she taps "sign transaction" and uses the QR scanner to import the partially signed transaction from Bob's phone.

{% include image-gallery.html pages = page.images_alice-sign-transfer %} 

Once imported, Alice's app displays the transaction details, showing that it has been signed by Bob and requires her signature to complete. Alice reviews the transaction details and initiates the signing process.

After she completes the signing flow  with her BitBox, the app automatically broadcasts the fully signed transaction to the Bitcoin network. If she would like to have more control and broadcast transactions manually, Alice could change this behavior in the app settings.

Back on the home screen, Alice sees that the transaction is being confirmed by the network. After it has been confirmed, the app shows a reminder that the original wallet should be archived. 

### Archiving the old wallet

Archiving unused wallets removes complexity and helps users focus on the wallets they actively use. Archiving a wallet does not delete it from the app. It is only removed from the home screen and from the wallets tab. 

The app will still monitor the Bitcoin blockchain for incoming transactions. If there are any, they are shown on the home screen and in the wallets tab. Users can then transfer the funds to a wallet that they actively use. This is why it is important to keep the backup kit and at least one of the primary keys of every wallet.   

{% include image-gallery.html pages = page.images_archive-wallet %}

### Alternative approach
As you can see, making changes to a multi-key wallet can be a tedious process. An alternative to replacing the David's key would be for David to simply import the backup of his existing private key into a new signing device. This approach has some advantages:

1. **Simplicity**: It doesn't require creating a new wallet or moving funds, which incurs transaction fees.
1. **Convenience**: Other family members wouldn't need to be involved in the process.

However, there are also significant downsides:

1. **Security risk**: If the original device was stolen rather than just lost, the thief might eventually gain access to the private key, putting the funds at risk.
1. **Potential compromise**: If there's any chance the seed phrase backup was exposed or compromised, using it again could jeopardize the wallet's security.

In a multi-key setup, a single compromised key doesn't immediately put the funds at risk because multiple keys are required to authorize a transaction. In addition to that, the inheritance key set is protected by the timelocks that Alice and Bob have put in place. However, it does reduce the overall security of the wallet.

## Changing the wallet configuration

If the Joneses would want to change only the wallet configuration the process would be the same. In the example below, Bob changes the activation timelock for the recovery path and the inheritance key set from 6 months to 12 months. After the new wallet is created, the process will be the same as described above.
