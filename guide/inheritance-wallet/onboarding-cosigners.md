So far, the wallet has been created on Bob's app. The next step is to get Alice set up as well and to activate the wallet on their signing devices. The couple needs to go throught the following three steps:

1. Bob shares the wallet configuration with Alice.
2. Alice imports the wallet to her app.
3. Bob and Alice activate the wallet on their signing devices.
