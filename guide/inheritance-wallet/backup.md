Editor's notes

This page covers how users backup their wallet and an example approach of how to store the backup material.

# Wallet backup

As we have covered in the time-based recovery [reference design]({{ '/guide/savings-wallet/time-based-recovery/' | relative_url }}) there are two parts to backing up a multi-key wallet: the private keys as well as the wallet configuration.

{% include picture.html
   image = "/assets/images/guide/inheritance-wallet/wallet-backup/multikey-backup-components.png"
   retina = "/assets/images/guide/inheritance-wallet/wallet-backup/multikey-backup-components@2x.png"
   alt-text = "An illustration showing the two parts of a multi-key wallet backup."
   width = 1600
   height = 800
%}

Users need not only to back up the individual private keys that are used to sign transactions. But they also have to back up the wallet configuration as such. This is needed for recovery, because the wallet application needs to know how to generate addresses and the rules that define how bitcoin can be spent from these addresses. 

This means that, in our use case, the Joneses need to safely backup and store six private keys as well as the wallet configuration. 

### Private key backups
Of course, all six private keys need to be backed up properly. We describe some best practices on how to back up private keys on the [bitcoin backups page]({{ '/guide/how-it-works/backups/' | relative_url }}), so we wonâ€™t be covering this topic here. 

Our app emphasizes that users should keep one of the primary keys at all times, even if they move their funds to a new wallet. The reason is simple: there is still the possibility that some bitcoins will be sent to that old wallet. Keeping one of the keys around will make sure that users will be able to spend such funds, because the recovery path will be available to them.

### Wallet configuration backup
After the wallet has been created, the application prompts Bob to download the wallet backup kit. 

#### Bob saves the backup kit
Bob saves the the backup kit into his password manager that he has enabled on his phone. 

{% include image-gallery.html pages = page.images_wallet-backup %}

Alice and Bob then encrypt the ZIP file with a strong password and both of them stores a copy of it in their personal password manager account, case they need to recover the wallet themselves.

#### What is in the backup kit?
The backup kit is just a ZIP file that contains the following contents:

<div class="center" markdown="1">

{% include picture.html
   image = "/assets/images/guide/inheritance-wallet/wallet-backup/backup-kit-contents.png"
   retina = "/assets/images/guide/inheritance-wallet/wallet-backup/backup-kit-contents@2x.png"
   alt-text = "An illustration showing what is included in the backup kit."
   width = 1600
   height = 800
   layout = "float-right-desktop"
%} 

**A PDF file** that contains the wallet descriptor and information about all six XPUBs. Is also contains a visual representation of the rules that are used to unlock the recovery path and the inheritance key set.

**Wallet backup files in various formats**, which can be used to import the wallet to other wallet applications like Sparrow, Nunchuk or others.

## Backup distribution

Alice and Bob are not willing to trust their life savings to one application. That's why they carefully chose the way in which they store the above wallet backup material. The illustration below shows the chosen setup in more detail.

{% include picture.html
   image = "/assets/images/guide/inheritance-wallet/wallet-backup/recovery-tool-distribution.png"
   retina = "/assets/images/guide/inheritance-wallet/wallet-backup/recovery-tool-distribution@2x.png"
   modalImage = "/assets/images/guide/inheritance-wallet/wallet-backup/recovery-tool-distribution@2x.png"
   mobile = "/assets/images/guide/inheritance-wallet/wallet-backup/recovery-tool-distribution-mobile.png"
   mobileRetina = "/assets/images/guide/inheritance-wallet/wallet-backup/recovery-tool-distribution-mobile@2x.png"
   modalImageMobile = "/assets/images/guide/inheritance-wallet/wallet-backup/recovery-tool-distribution-mobile@2x.png"
   alt-text = "A schematic illustration showing how the backup material is distributed between the parents, their children and the lawyer."
   width = 1600
   height = 800
   modalWidth = 3324
   modalHeight = 1850
   modalWidthMobile = 1156
   modalHeightMobile = 2936
%}

Please note that this is one of many possible ways to approach wallet backups and should not be understood as the only correct way to do it.

It is important that users determine the best way to handle backups based on their own specific circumstances. Factors that will influence such decisions include the relationship between family members, the amount of funds stored, their access to safe locations, etc. Based on these and other factors it can be more appropriate to chose a simpler or more advanced backup scheme. 

We would also like to reiterate the point made in the "Use case & scope" page: the complexity of the backup scheme increases with the complexity of the wallet configuration. Therefore, user education is critical during wallet creation as well as during the backup phase.

## Assembling the backup material

The illustration above reveals that Christina and David can access in two different ways.

#### Self-sovereign route
Bob and Alice want to provide the children a way to access the funds on their own, using only the backup parts that are stored in the house safe. They store the password in a tamper-evident bag, along with a USB drive. Since electronics can fail, they also place a printout of their will and the recovery PDF in it. 

The PIN to the house safe is stored in the shared family vault in the password manager, where the family also keeps other digital items.

This is an acceptable trade-off for them, since they have good relationships and trust their children. After all, this is the reason they have chosen to include them in the setup in the first place.

But even if Christina and David would breach that trust and recover the wallet, they would not be able to move the funds, because their inheritance keys are timelocked. They would only be able to see the balance and monitor transactions, but they would not be able to spend any bitcoins. 

Because Alice and Bob access their safe regularly, they would notice that the bag with the backup material has been opened. They can then safely move the funds to a new wallet, for which they would implement more restrictive security measures.

#### Assisted route

But what if the first route fails? In that case, Christina and David should have a way to gain access to the backup material by going through the standard legal procedures. This is why Bob and Alice give their lawyer Edward a copy of the encrypted backup kit. The password is stored in a deposit box at their bank, in a tamper-evident bag. 

This setup will prevent Edward from recovering the wallet, because he does not know how or where to access the backup kit password. It also prevents bank employees from doing so, because the backup kit is not stored in the deposit box along with the password. 

But it will enable Christina and David to access both parts of the wallet backup through legal channels upon their parents' death.

#### Why backup redundancy?
The reason that there are two different ways in which Christina and David can gain access to the full backup material is redundancy. Redundancy is important because it is possible that one of the two routes fail.

### Example resources

Below is an example of the backup PDF file. The first page contains the information about the wallet itself. This includes the name of the wallet as well as the [wallet descriptor]({{ '/guide/glossary/#output-script-descriptor' | relative_url }}) in the form of a QR code as well as in clear text. It also shows a visual representation of the configuration of the key sets:

{% include picture.html
   image = "/assets/images/guide/inheritance-wallet/wallet-backup/recovery-pdf.png"
   retina = "/assets/images/guide/inheritance-wallet/wallet-backup/recovery-pdf@2x.png"
   modalImage = "/assets/images/guide/inheritance-wallet/wallet-backup/recovery-pdf@2x.png"
   alt-text = "An example of the recovery PDF file."
   width = 1600
   height = 800
   modalWidth = 4050
   modalHeight = 2168
%}

The subsequent pages describe the key sets and the individual signing keys, including the friendly names that Bob has given them. This will make it more convenient in case the wallet needs to be recovered.
