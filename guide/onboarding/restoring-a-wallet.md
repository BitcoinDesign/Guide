# Restoring a wallet

<div class="center" markdown="1">

There are a number of reasons why a user might need to recover their wallet. Typically, this might be because they lost their device, had it stolen, are migrating from a different wallet or deleted and redownloaded a particular wallet application. Regardless of how it occurred, itâ€™s important that your wallet application has clear, easy instructions that provide an easy way for users to recover their funds. There are a number of ways that a wallet recovery can be done. However, as covered in the [wallet interoperability]({{ 'guide/designing-products/wallet-interoperability' | relative_url }}) section, not all wallets from one application can be recovered in another.

### Restore from an automatic cloud backup

As outlined earlier in the chapter, we consider an automatic cloud backup a good option, especially for beginners. One of the major UX benefits of this is a seamless recovery process. All users needs to do to gain access to their funds again is to log into their cloud storage account.

If they aren't logged in, they only need to enter their password before the wallet can automatically access the recovery phrase stored on the user's iCloud or Google Drive account. Once the recovery phrase is located, the wallet can begin to regenerate the keys required for the user to access their funds.

### Restore with recovery phrase

Users of your bitcoin wallet may also have created other wallets with different providers. If this is the case, they can transfer that wallet into yours by entering their 12 or 24-word recovery phrase. There are several ways you can choose to allow a user to enter a recovery phase. These were outlined earlier in the [manual backup]({{ 'guide/onboarding/backing-up-a-recovery-phrase/manual-backup/' | relative_url }}) section of this chapter.

### Restore from an encrypted QR code backup

You might also provide the option for users to scan an encrypted QR code version of their recovery phrase. This has two key benefits:

1. Switching between a mobile OS is easier.
2. It provides the option for more redundant backups.

For a more detailed explantion of this recovery technique check out this [blog post](https://blog.keys.casa/product-update-transaction-memos-encrypted-backups/) by Casa.

Some less popular methods include importing a file such as wallet.dat. Such a file would have all the information required to recover funds such as public keys and key metadata. In some cases you might be developing a watch-only wallet that only lets users track their bitcoin transactions. In this case you would import an extended public key, this tends to be for technically minded users however.
