# Funding a wallet

Common problems faced by new users include buying their first bitcoin and transferring it to a new wallet. For this, most will purchase their first bitcoin from an exchange using a national or fiat currency. This generally involves providing some form of documentation (such as ID) and already having a bank account. After purchasing their bitcoin, they can then send it to an external wallet. While this works, there are better alternatives available. Understanding how your users fund their wallets can help you create more tailored and dedicated UI flows. Certain ways users fund their wallets are outlined below.

### Earning bitcoin

Earning bitcoin through exchange of goods and services is a great option. Some individuals and businesses have already started accepting and even paying employees in bitcoin.

As noted, most exchanges offer the option to buy bitcoin using fiat currencies. Once purchased, users can transfer those funds to a separate, external wallet. This might confuse new users who don't understand the difference between exchange wallets and personal wallets.

Bitcoin ATMs are another great option for new users to exchange cash for bitcoin in person. These machines also let users trade their bitcoin for cash, which can be useful if they are somewhere new or foreign.

Finally, new users can buy bitcoin directly from other bitcoin users such as friends, other users at a meetup, or intermediary services like [localbitcoins](https://localbitcoins.com/).

Users funding new wallets from an exchange could potentially come into contact with unknown concepts, such as a bitcoin address, QR code, or transaction confirmations. This is an excellent opportunity to explain the exchange to personal wallet flow.

### Redeem bitcoin using a gift card

Gift cards allow users to buy and own small amounts of bitcoin without having to sign up for an exchange. These cards are sometimes available from local retailers.

Users can get set up in minutes using this technique.
