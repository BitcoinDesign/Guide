# Getting to know your users

When building onboarding experiences, it is important to understand and develop knowledge about your users.
Within the Bitcoin ecosystem, there is a wide range in the level of expertise. Identifying who you are building for is crucial, as these user groups value and understand varying characteristics of coin management tools. For example, “rookies” often favor convenient, easy-to-use wallets, while well-versed bitcoin owners tend to prioritize security[^1].

For example, you might want to improve the onboarding experience for new users. This could take the form of research where you talk to a range of participants and observe what they do, how they think, and what they want. While observing, you may ask yourself things like:

* Do they trust my product? 
* Where do they experience frustration?
* Where does the first experience take place?
* How did they hear about my application? Word of mouth? App store search? 
* Do first time users have specific needs or goals?

Aim to gather as much information and observations as possible in order to empathize with your users.

You can then use this research to identify where potential problems may exist. This will then allow you to highlight opportunities for innovation. Look to draw parallels between a user’s traditional financial experience vs how they use bitcoin. Then, you can look to identify unmet user needs and craft experiences with that context in mind. 

Allow you and your team to be as free and creative about how you might solve these unmet needs. No idea is too “out there”. Gather as many ideas as possible and build upon each other's ideas as you move along. Also look for already existing research and findings to compare against what you have found and check for any similarities. 

Next you can think about prototyping a subset of these ideas and understand the feasibility of your ideas through feedback on these prototypes. Put your prototypes in front of real users and test to verify the solution meets the users needs.

Ultimately the goal of onboarding is that users trust the application, feel comfortable using it, and are set up for success. They should have an idea of how this application is going to fit into their lives and take care of certain needs. It's also ideal if they can already envision the next time they will use it.
