Editor's notes

A brief history of bitcoin "branding" and the visual culture around bitcoin.

A good addition would be a summary of the basic brand elements (color, symbol...).

# The visual language of bitcoin

Since Bitcoin does not have a central authority, there is no specific symbol or style that we can consider official. However, there is a large body of community art and design work, along with a few proposals that ended up being highly influential. Let's start with some key moments that led us to the visual that many of us associate with Bitcoin today.

### Original symbol

<div class="center" markdown="1">

{% include image.html
   image = "/assets/images/guide/getting-started/visual-language/satoshi-2010.png"
   retina = "/assets/images/guide/getting-started/visual-language/satoshi-2010@2x.png"
   alt-text = "The original Bitcoin symbol from 2010"
   width = 140
   height = 140
   layout = "float-left"
%}

This original icon was a golden coin with bold initial "BC" inscribed, created by Satoshi Nakamoto for the original Bitcoin Core client.

</div>

<div class="image-gallery" markdown="1">

{% include image.html
   image = "/assets/images/guide/getting-started/visual-language/early-bitcoin-core-wallet.jpg"
   alt-text = "Screenshot of an early version of the Bitcoin Core application"
   caption = "The original logo in an early version of the Bitcoin Core wallet."
   width = 640
   height = 300
%}

</div>

### Updated symbol

<div class="center" markdown="1">

{% include image.html
   image = "/assets/images/guide/getting-started/visual-language/satoshi-update-2010.png"
   retina = "/assets/images/guide/getting-started/visual-language/satoshi-update-2010@2x.png"
   alt-text = "Updated version of the Bitcoin symbool"
   width = 140
   height = 140
   layout = "float-left"
%}

On February 24, 2010, Satoshi posted an updated icon that adopted the capital "B" with two vertical lines ([archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20130524055823/https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=64.0), [bitcointalk.org](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=64.0)).

### Update by Bitboy

<div class="center" markdown="1">

{% include image.html
   image = "/assets/images/guide/getting-started/visual-language/bitboy-2011.png"
   retina = "/assets/images/guide/getting-started/visual-language/bitboy-2011@2x.png"
   alt-text = "A new version of the Bitcoin symbol that we still use today"
   width = 140
   height = 140
   layout = "float-left"
%}

On November 1, 2010, a user named bitboy proposed a new icon and set of promotional graphics on the Bitcointalk forum ([archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20130524191250/https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1631.0), [bitcointalk.org](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1631.0)). This iteration embraced a simple, flat style with the hex color #F7931A and a 14-degree rotation.

</div>

<div class="image-gallery" markdown="1">

{% include image.html
   image = "/assets/images/guide/getting-started/visual-language/bitboy-promotional-graphics.png"
   retina = "/assets/images/guide/getting-started/visual-language/bitboy-promotional-graphics@2x.png"
   alt-text = "Promotional Bitcoin graphics like buttons and stickers"
   caption = "Promotional graphics created by bitboy."
   width = 573
   height = 567
%}

</div>

### The Unicode symbol

<div class="center" markdown="1">

{% include image.html
   image = "/assets/images/guide/getting-started/visual-language/unicode-symbol.png"
   retina = "/assets/images/guide/getting-started/visual-language/unicode-symbol@2x.png"
   alt-text = "Bitcoin unicode symbol"
   width = 140
   height = 140
   layout = "float-left"
%}

The Unicode symbol for Bitcoin (₿) was introduced in [Unicode 10.0.0](http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode10.0.0/) on June 20, 2017. This was an important step for establishing Bitcoin as a currency symbol alongside the US Dollar ($), Euro (€) and others. Few fonts support the symbol as of late 2020.

</div>

## Beyond the symbol

Because Bitcoin is such an open project, there have been endless creative explorations and visualizations. Below are a few categories to provide structure.

### Memes

From moon Lambos to the price rollercoaster, memes naturally arise from the sheer infinite conversations of Bitcoiners around the globe. Certain graphics, stories, jokes, and ideas stick and spread and become recognizable visuals by the community and are remixed and repeated repeatedly.

<div class="image-gallery" markdown="1">

{% include image.html
   image = "/assets/images/guide/getting-started/visual-language/memes.jpg"
   retina = "/assets/images/guide/getting-started/visual-language/memes@2x.jpg"
   alt-text = "Examples of popular bitcoin memes"
   caption = "References from top left to bottom right, <a href='http://www.brainlesstales.com/bitcoin-roller-coaster' target='_blank'>1</a>, <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1gagle/lol_new_bitcoin_billboard_in_san_jose_honey_badger/' target='_blank'>2</a>, unknown author, <a href='https://medium.com/@paulbars/magic-internet-money-how-a-reddit-ad-made-bitcoin-hit-1000-and-inspired-south-parks-art-b414ec7a5598' target='_blank'>4</a>, unknown author, unknown author."
   width = 800
   height = 421
%}

</div>

### The gold metaphor

Most likely stemming from the original depiction as a gold coin, there is a common illustration style based on this idea. This also builds on the narrative of Bitcoin is a type of digital gold, for which additional elements of binary code or electrical circuits are also often added. On the other end of the spectrum of realism is the depiction of Bitcoin in the style of video game coins, which is more relatable than gold coins to a native digital audience.

<div class="image-gallery" markdown="1">

{% include image.html
   image = "/assets/images/guide/getting-started/visual-language/metaphors.jpg"
   retina = "/assets/images/guide/getting-started/visual-language/metaphors@2x.jpg"
   alt-text = "Examples of illustrations of bitcoin as a physical coin or gold"
   caption = "References from top left to bottom right, unknown author, <a href='https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/bitcoin-design_2082416.htm' target='_blank'>2</a>, unknown author, unknown author, <a href='https://wall.alphacoders.com/big.php?i=794593' target='_blank'>4</a>, <a href='https://wall.alphacoders.com/big.php?i=939776' target='_blank'>5</a>."
   width = 800
   height = 500
%}

</div>

### Illustrations

Magazines, blogs, and other publications often hire professional illustrators to create custom visuals for specific stories. Additionally, companies that integrate or build on Bitcoin also frequently create unique marketing materials. Because Bitcoin does not have any official style, we see many different visual expressions in these illustrations.

<div class="image-gallery" markdown="1">

{% include image.html
   image = "/assets/images/guide/getting-started/visual-language/illustrations.jpg"
   retina = "/assets/images/guide/getting-started/visual-language/illustrations@2x.jpg"
   alt-text = "Examples of professional illustrations involving bitcoin"
   caption = "References from top left to bottom right, <a href='https://www.behance.net/gallery/66922301/Cryptoshop_Spot' target='_blank'>1</a>, <a href='https://www.behance.net/gallery/16903103/INSIDE-THE-WILD-WORLD-OF-BITCOIN' target='_blank'>2</a>, <a href='https://www.behance.net/gallery/25226745/Bitcoin-Illustration-for-an-internal-corporale-mag' target='_blank'>3</a>, <a href='https://www.behance.net/gallery/55850063/Waiting-for-Bitcoin' target='_blank'>4</a>, <a href='https://www.behance.net/gallery/56839949/The-Bitcoin-Knight' target='_blank'>5</a>, <a href='https://www.behance.net/gallery/58381785/Cryptocurrency' target='_blank'>6</a>, <a href='https://www.behance.net/gallery/59591697/Miss-Currency' target='_blank'>7</a>, <a href='https://www.behance.net/gallery/59920255/WIRED-Backchannel-The-Future-of-Bitcoin' target='_blank'>8</a>, <a href='https://mercuryo.io' target='_blank'>9</a>, <a href='' target='_blank'>10</a>, <a href='https://cash.app/bitcoin' target='_blank'>11</a>."
   width = 800
   height = 608

</div>

## The expression scale

A good way to think about the visual language of Bitcoin is of a scale that ranges from minimal to highly expressive. Despite the images below looking and communicating so differently, they can all still be recognized as capturing Bitcoin. One of the great aspects of public, community-owned identities like the one Bitcoin has, is that all of these expressions are equally legitimate and valid. This provides enormous creative freedom to designers that we should explore and take advantage of.

{% include image.html
   image = "/assets/images/guide/getting-started/visual-language/expression-scale.png"
   retina = "/assets/images/guide/getting-started/visual-language/expression-scale@2x.png"
   alt-text = "Sequence of images showing the bitcoin symbol illustrated in mininimal and expressive ways"
   caption = ""
   width = 800
   height = 133
%}

In digital product design, there are times when a minimally expressive approach is most appropriate. For example, when a user makes a transaction, we want them to be highly focused and not distract them with graphics. At other times, illustrations and stronger visual elements are more appropriate, and this is where we can take advantage of the creative freedom Bitcoin affords.

As you have seen, the expression if bitcoin is shaped by its user base. This brings us to our next topic, which is [user-research]({{ '/guide/getting-started/user-research/' | relative_url }}).
