# Why Bitcoin is unique

The internet has changed the world. Barriers to global communication and the exchange of information are reduced to almost nothing. Bitcoin adds another important dimension to this and brings us a natively digital method for storing and transferring value.

<!--
The status quo is that currencies are created and managed by governments and online payments are routed through the payment networks of large corporations. Government authority ensures that currencies are recognized and backed, while payment providers stay on top of fraud, prevent double-spending, provide security and various other benefits and services. This highly complex system works well enough for most people.

Bitcoins unique and clever combination of different technologies has managed to create both a currency and a payment network that can be trusted without government or corporate authorities. This innovation does not only open up global payments to anyone with a smartphone or computer, it also allows for storing value outside of traditional economic systems. This does not mean that bitcoin will replace existing currencies. Instead, it can complement them by better serving audiences and use cases that are typically difficult and expensive, as well as opening up completely new possibilities.

We have already hinted at some of the unique properties of Bitcoin, but letâ€™s go through them one by one, seen through the lens of Bitcoin as money.

## It's money, but digital

<div class="center" markdown="1">

The economic definition of money typically involves three specific [functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money#Functions) (medium of exchange, unit of account, store of value) and five [properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money#Properties) (durability, portability, fungibility, scarcity, divisibility, recognizability). Although bitcoin is a new breed of money, it still satisfies all of these requirements. Instead of relying on physical properties (like gold and silver) or trust in central authorities (like traditional currencies), bitcoin relies on a network of thousands of computers to enforce its mathematically defined ruleset.

## You own it

When we carry cash, we are entirely in control of its value. When we purchase something and give the cash away, it is gone. Online banking and payments rely on third parties that hold our money for us and allow us to access it through their websites and applications. Bitcoin manages to combine the benefits of cash as a bearer instrument with online banking convenience. When you control your bitcoin private keys, nobody in the world can take your bitcoin.

## Global by default

Bitcoin can be used by anyone with an internet connection, which is available to around [53.6% of the world population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Internet_usage), a number that is growing quickly. Some aspects of bitcoin, like key and address generation, even work without being online. This makes it the first truly globally available form of money that is unbound by country borders. People from around the world can freely transact without having to rely on middlemen like currency exchanges and local payment services.

## All participants are treated equally

<div class="center" markdown="1">

Bitcoin as a technical protocol relies on addresses and does not work with persons' concepts, real-life identities, or even user names. Individuals, companies, governments, and anyone else interact with it on a level playing field with the same rights and benefits. No group can shut another group out at a fundamental level, censor transactions, or confiscate bitcoin. This naturally only applies to bitcoin itself, and services built on bitcoin may enforce identity verification and discriminate between users.

</div>

## It complements existing financial systems

Around [1.7 billion adults](https://globalfindex.worldbank.org/sites/globalfindex/files/chapters/2017%20Findex%20full%20report_chapter2.pdf) do not have access to banking services, including roughly [55 million US citizens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unbanked#The_unbanked_in_the_United_States). Reasons may include that lack of availability of financial services, lack of trustworthy institutions, or exclusion of certain parts of the population due to their legal, social or financial status. Bitcoin has the potential to serve these individuals, as it is an unbiased, open, and public network. This can be an incredibly equalizing force for many people and use cases and opens up new economic opportunities.

## It is open-source

How many currencies and payment networks allow anyone to show up, participate and contribute? This has traditionally not been possible since those systems rely on central authorities to function. Bitcoin relies on thousands of volunteer contributors to collaboratively keep the system running, evolve it, and build services on top of it. This community of passionate contributors creates the free software that keeps Bitcoin running and allows everyone to interact with it as they desire.
