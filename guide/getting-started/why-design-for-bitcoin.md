Editor's notes

Frames the role and activity of design in the bitcoin ecosystem, and how
it is unique and interesting compared to other areas of design. This should
strike a good balance between highlighting exciting opportunities and the
reality of contributing.

# Why design for bitcoin

At first, Bitcoin may sound like a complex technical innovation. A closer inspection reveals exciting new opportunities for designers to shape user experiences that can make a fundamental difference for people worldwide. So much of our lives is tied to money and financial systems, yet we sometimes have so little control or influence. Bitcoin has the potential to balance this, and it's up to us to make it a reality.

## Be on the cutting edge

The Bitcoin white paper was released in 2008. Over a decade later, it is still a young and maturing technology full of potential. Like working early on the internet, there are big and exciting questions to be discussed and design decisions to be made. Designing for bitcoin is a fantastic and rewarding challenge.

## Permissionless

The idea that there are no gatekeepers is baked into the foundation of Bitcoin and its ecosystem. A Bitcoin wallet designed by you is as official as one created by a big corporation.

## Blaze the trail

There are still very few dedicated designers working in the Bitcoin ecosystem. As we have seen with the evolution of the internet, it takes time to adopt new technology. If you are curious and excited about new challenges, here's your chance.

## Design for your needs

Many bitcoin projects start by identifying an unmet need. Unlike traditional finance, the barriers to entry are shallow. So if you were ever unhappy with the service of your bank or financial provider, here's your chance to shape something better.

## Work in public

Bitcoin is open-source, and designing for Bitcoin allows you also work on the same ideas of publicly sharing and collaborating on design information. Free from agencies and corporations' structures, open collaboration allows every participant to have a voice and shape the way they work based on their interests and preferences.

## Design money

Money is a powerful force and therefore heavily regulated and controlled. The composition of bitcoin allows us to trust in its value and availability while also providing vast freedom to experiment and build on top of it. The emergence of thousands of so-called alternative coins, hundreds of wallets, and the many bitcoin businesses are the most apparent signifier of just how open this space is.

## Join a global community

The doors are wide open, and Bitcoin design is discussed publicly online and any social media service you can think of. Design and build with friends and strangers, participate in the various communities and help shape an ecosystem for design and creativity.
