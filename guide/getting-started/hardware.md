Editor's notes

This page provides an overview of the different types of hardware that interact with the bitcoin network. It is only a top-level summary. An idea for future expansion would be create sub-pages
to more thoroughly discuss each hardware type.

# Hardware overview

General purpose hardware, like personal computers and smartphones, work great for most basic bitcoin operations. In some circumstances, dedicated hardware devices are optimized for the nuances of bitcoin. We’ll explore them and how they work here.

## Physical backups

Recovery phrases and other important recovery data such as descriptors are often backed up physically. Many simple, cheap, and robust physical backup solutions for bitcoin exist.

   retina = "/assets/images/guide/getting-started/hardware/hardware-seed-storage@2x.jpg"

Many users back up their wallet using metal plates that have their recovery phrase etched into them. This protects the recovery phrase from physical destruction from fire and  water. [Seedplate](https://seedplate.com/) is an example of such a product.

A simpler option is writing your recovery phrase on a piece of paper. Compared to steel, paper can be easily destroyed, making this option less secure.

Some applications such as [Muun](https://blog.muun.com/why-not-just-a-mnemonic/) have users print out encrypted PDF backups that contain all the required recovery data, not just the recovery phrase.

See [bitcoin backups]({{ '/guide/private-key-management/backups/' | relative_url }}) for more details.

## Hardware wallets

You may already be familiar with physical security keys from your bank or work. They are small devices with built-in authentication that control and secure access to a device or service. Security keys are not connected to the Internet (air-gapped), or any other network so they are difficult to tamper with.

Bitcoin hardware wallets, also known as external signers, act like bitcoin centric security keys. They isolate the recovery phrase and private keys from the internet and other devices.

Hardware wallets only exchange non-sensitive information with external devices. Sensitive processes, such as signing a transaction to open a Lightning network payment channel, happen on the device. Most interactions with hardware wallets happen via desktop [software, like wallets]({{ '/guide/getting-started/software/#wallets' | relative_url }}).

## Nodes

A node is a device that participates in a network. There are two types of nodes to understand: A bitcoin node which participates in the bitcoin network, and a Lightning node which participates in the Lightning network. For a deeper dive into what purpose these nodes serve check out the [technology primer]({{ '/guide/getting-started/technology-primer/' | relative_url }}).

It is quite common to have dedicated hardware to run bitcoin [node software]({{ '/guide/getting-started/software/#nodes' | relative_url }}). This ensures your node stays in sync with the network and is regularly verifying the network rules, increasing bitcoin’s security. Some node software also comes packaged with other third-party applications which may benefit from dedicated hardware and more regular uptime.

Lightning node software can be run on a smartphone. Though, this often comes with trusting a third-party for certain node functions such as payment path construction. For this reason, dedicated hardware Lightning nodes may be a better option for those who do not want a trust-minimized setup.

Heavy users of the Lightning Network, such as routing node operators, often run Lightning nodes on dedicated hardware. Lightning nodes require 24/7 uptime, which is much easier to achieve with dedicated hardware. Lightning nodes also require the private keys to be stored on the same device. Dedicated hardware reduces the attack surface and makes it easier to secure these keys.

[Plug-and-play hardware nodes](https://samouraiwallet.com/nodl) exist and make it simple to set up a dedicated hardware node. The most common way people run dedicated hardware nodes is installing a node OS, like [Umbrel](https://getumbrel.com/) or [MyNode](https://mynodebtc.com/), on a hardware device.

See [nodes]({{ '/guide/glossary/node/' | relative_url }}) for more details.

## Mining hardware

Miners are the backbone of bitcoin generating new blocks, which creates new bitcoin. Dedicated mining hardware, which runs dedicated [mining software]({{ '/guide/getting-started/software/#mining-software' | relative_url }}), exists for mining bitcoin. Various billion dollar industries have developed around the manufacture and deployment of such hardware.

When bitcoin was first launched back in 2009, mining hardware was mostly conducted by CPUs and GPUs. As the network grew in size, and the market around mining grew, more specialized and powerful hardware known as application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) became the standard mining hardware.

Today, most bitcoin miners are SHA-256 ASICs. They are optimized to continuously execute the SHA-256 hashing algorithm with the goal of finding a suitable hash and thus mining a new bitcoin block. Modern miners (2021) are capable of producing 100 trillion hashes per second.

## ATMs

Bitcoin Automated Teller Machines (ATM) are a convenient way to buy or sell bitcoin using cash or card.

   retina = "/assets/images/guide/getting-started/hardware/atm@2x.jpg"
   mobile = "/assets/images/guide/getting-started/hardware/atm-mobile.jpg"
   mobileRetina = "/assets/images/guide/getting-started/hardware/atm-mobile@2x.jpg"
   alt-text = "Examples of hardware wallets"
   width = 800
   height = 400

Much like traditional ATMs, bitcoin ATMs allow the deposit and withdrawal of money. Bitcoin ATMs however allow someone to deposit fiat currencies in exchange for bitcoin.

Modern bitcoin ATMs take advantage of the bitcoin Lightning network. This enables almost instant withdrawals and cheaper fees, which makes the purchase experience more friendly and cost effective.

Bitcoin ATMs are usually bound to local money transmission laws and regulations, such as Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations. More on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin_ATM).

You can find local ATMs using services like [coinatmradar](https://coinatmradar.com/).
