# Code resources

Although mostly focused on design, some members of the community also have their hands in various code resources that are based on, or influenced by the Bitcoin Design Guide. They are all open source and free to use, modify and contribute to.

## Bitcoin UI Kit packages

The Bitcoin UI Kit is a great resource for designing bitcoin products. While the main effort is on the design components and Figma files, there are a couple of code implementations that make adopting the designs in the guide much easier.

- Bitcoin UI Kit for [Swift](https://github.com/reez/WalletUI)
- Bitcoin UI Kit for [Flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/bitcoin_ui_kit)

## Wallet implementations

Several different projects are building on the reference designs from the guide. They all have slightly different goals and are at different stages, but are all fantastic learning resources for other people wanting to build a wallet.
