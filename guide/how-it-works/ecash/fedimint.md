# Fedimint
Fedimint is the first bitcoin-backed ecash protocol. Fedimint decentralizes trust across a federation of guardians, ensuring that no single guardian has complete control over user funds. Fedimint allows for various Federation configurations, each catering to a community's specific needs and trust relationships

## Federated mints

Federated Mints are the standard when it comes to security and resilience in the Fedimint protocol. Managed by four or more guardians, each running their own Fedimint server, this setup distributes control and minimizes risk.

#### Pros:

* **Security** - No single guardian can control the mint, reducing the risk of theft or mismanagement.

* **High resilience** - The mint remains operational even if one or more guardians are temporarily offline, ensuring continuous access.

#### Cons:

* **Complex setup** - Coordinating multiple guardians adds steps and cost.

## Role of guardians
Guardians are participants who collaboratively manage a federation's operations. They secure the federation's funds using multi-sig wallets, validate payments through consensus, and control ecash issuance and redemption.

## Role of gateways

On the right, another dotted line connects the gateway to an image of lightning bolts, symbolizing bitcoin on the lightning network."

A [gateway](https://fedimint.org/docs/GettingStarted/TechCompontents#lightning-swaps) is a service that facilitates interactions between the federation and the lightning network. A gateway acts as a bridge, enabling users within the federation to make payments to and receive payments on the lightning network.

**How gateways work**: The gateway accepts bitcoin payments on the lightning network and converts them into the bitcoin-backed ecash tokens used within the federation. It can also convert bitcoin-backed ecash tokens into bitcoin and send them over the lightning network. This is crucial because it allows the users within a federation to interact with the outside bitcoin and lightning network.

## When to use Fedimint
Use Fedimint whenever a custodial Lightning and ecash wallet is required, and single points of failure aren't acceptable. For example, when larger amounts are being stored or reliability is a concern.
