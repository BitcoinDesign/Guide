Below you will find best practices for Ecash in general, cashu specifics, and fedimint specifics.


## Ecash best design practices
Ecash general best design practices.

### Multiple mint display
A paragraph explaining the importance of displaying multiple mints, and some design considerations to keep in mind.

{% include image-gallery.html pages = page.images_general %}

#### Pending tokens

<div class="center" markdown="1">

{% include picture.html
   image = "/assets/images/guide/daily-spending-wallet/settings/fees.png"
   retina = "/assets/images/guide/daily-spending-wallet/settings/fees@2x.png"
   modalImage = "/assets/images/guide/daily-spending-wallet/settings/fees-big.png"
   alt-text = ""
   width = 250
   height = 541
   layout = "float-right-desktop -background -shadow"
   caption = "The fees screen provides a clear overview of all fees that may be charged."
%}

A paragraph explaining the importance of displaying pending tokens.

</div>

## Cashu best practices
A paragraph introduction to cashu specific best practices.

### Meta data

[Security]({{ '/guide/daily-spending-wallet/security/' | relative_url }}) is all about preventing unwanted access to the application. Basic access options (PIN, FaceID) are configured during [first use]({{ '/guide/daily-spending-wallet/first-use/' | relative_url }}), and users receive regular reminders to review them. Wallet limits are an additional option, only available in settings, to block potentially unwanted high-value payments.

{% include image-gallery.html pages = page.images_security %}

### Edit mint URL / Refresh mint settings

<div class="center" markdown="1">

{% include picture.html
   image = "/assets/images/guide/daily-spending-wallet/settings/wallet-backup.png"
   retina = "/assets/images/guide/daily-spending-wallet/settings/wallet-backup@2x.png"
   modalImage = "/assets/images/guide/daily-spending-wallet/settings/wallet-backup-big.png"
   alt-text = ""
   width = 250
   height = 541
   layout = "float-right-desktop -background -shadow"
   caption = "Backup options are typically configured in first use and rarely need to be accessed."
%}

A paragraph explaining the importance of giving the user the ability to edit a mint URL and refresh mint settings. Explain the connection to NUT06.

</div>

### P2PK Lock

Most users will not need or want to change network settings, but it is important to offer these features for those who do. While it may be personal preference for some, it may be a privacy or security matter for others to connect through services they personally maintain or trust. Interoperability is a core [design principle]({{ '/guide/getting-started/principles/#interoperability' | relative_url }}) and also makes the application more versatile.

{% include image-gallery.html pages = page.images_network %}

## Help & support

<div class="center" markdown="1">

{% include picture.html
   image = "/assets/images/guide/daily-spending-wallet/settings/help.png"
   retina = "/assets/images/guide/daily-spending-wallet/settings/help@2x.png"
   modalImage = "/assets/images/guide/daily-spending-wallet/settings/help-big.png"
   alt-text = ""
   width = 250
   height = 541
   layout = "float-right-desktop -background -shadow"
   caption = "Help & support options ensure users can get the right information when they need it."
%}

Open-source projects do not have large support teams but instead often rely on their communities and forum discussion to allow users to help each other. Contributors are also part of this activity but usually cannot dedicate time to address all support needs. Therefore it is important to provide several different methods to get help. It distributes the burden of support across documentation, community, and contributors.

Next, let's dive into the [savings wallet reference design]({{ '/guide/savings-wallet/' | relative_url }}).

{% include next-previous.html
   previousUrl = "/guide/daily-spending-wallet/privacy/"
   previousName = "Privacy"
   nextUrl = "/guide/savings-wallet/"
   nextName = "Savings wallet"
%}
