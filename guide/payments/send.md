# Sending bitcoin

Sending bitcoin is one of the most essential user activities in a bitcoin application, and also one of the least structured ones. People may want to send bitcoin to a known contact, transfer it to another wallet on a different device, or make a purchase via a [payment processor]({{ '/guide/getting-started/software/#payment-processors' | relative_url }}).

## Payment entry points

The need to send bitcoin can be triggered by many different use cases, and initiated by both sender and receiver. Common entry points are:

- Manual entry of address and amount
- Sending to a previously saved contact
- Copy & pasting payment information
- Clicking a payment link
- Scanning a QR code
- Receiving a contactless payment request (using [NFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-field_communication) or [Bluetooth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth))

Below are visualizations of some of these entry points.

{% include image-gallery.html pages = page.imagesEntryPoints %}

Since users cannot control how a payment request is presented to them, wallets should be highly flexible in terms of input options and [interoperability]({{ '/guide/designing-products/wallet-interoperability/' | relative_url }}). If your wallet does not support a particular payment request, users should be presented with a human readable [error]({{ '/guide/payments/send/#errors' | relative_url }}).

Payment information can be shared in many formats and over diverse communication channels. Each has its own advantages and limitations. More details on the [payment request formats]({{ '/guide/payments/request/payment-request-formats/' | relative_url }}) page.

## Presenting payment requests

Once the application has imported a payment request, it should provide clear instructions and options to the user.

{% include image-gallery.html pages = page.imagesEntryScreens %}

## Manual payment initiation

When responding to an invoice that contains all relevent information, the user can quickly review and approve it. In other scenarios, it may be required to manually enter or edit various details.

{% include image-gallery.html pages = page.imagesInfo %}

**Recipient**

The most convenient option for choosing a recipient is from previously saved contacts. Alternatively, users can enter on-chain addresses, Lightning addresses, Lightning node IDs, or other static identifies that are supported by the wallet.

There are also static [invoice types]({{ '/guide/payments/request/payment-request-formats/' | relative_url }}) that can receive payments repeatedly. These are less intuitive overall due to their appearance, but could also be considered payment endpoints.

**Amount**

If no amount is provided via a payment request, manual entry should be simple and convenient so users don’t accidentally send an incorrect amount. The amount should be displayed in bitcoin or satoshi value, as well as the user’s local currency. Options to quickly toggle between them should be available. More on the [Units & Symbols page]({{ '/guide/payments/units-and-symbols/' | relative_url }}).

**Meta data**

A transaction history is hard to make sense of when it only shows amounts, dates, and identifiers. Users should be allowed to add descriptions, tags, and other meta data to add context. This context can separately be used for helpful tools like visual spending breakdowns.

## Fees

Payment fees can drastically differ based on a few attributes:

<div class="center" markdown="1">

{% include image.html
   image = "/assets/images/guide/payments/send/fee-options.png"
   retina = "/assets/images/guide/payments/send/fee-options@2x.png"
   alt-text = "Examples of on-chain, Lightning and Lightning routing fees"
   width = 400
   height = 417
   layout = "float-right-desktop"
%}

**Lightning routing fees**

On the Lightning network, payments are passed between nodes to get from the sender to the receiver. Each of those nodes may charge a base fee and a second fee based on a percentage of the amount forwarded. Fees paid can vary, but are typically in the single-digit or double-digit Satoshi range (a small fraction of on-chain fees).

**Lightning service provider fees**

In certain situations, the Lightning wallet may not have enough channel liquidity to send a payment. Wallet providers may offer to alleviate these friction points, and earn additional fees. A common scenario is the automatic opening of a payment channel when a wallet attempts to send a payment larger than their outbound capacity.

</div>

<div class="center" markdown="1">

**On-chain fees**

{% include image.html
   image = "/assets/images/guide/payments/send/confirm-fees.png"
   retina = "/assets/images/guide/payments/send/confirm-fees@2x.png"
   alt-text = "Screen showing fee options for a transaction"
   caption = "On-chain fees can vary drastically and should be easy to edit."
   width = 250
   height = 541
   layout = "float-right-desktop -background -shadow"
%}

This fee is dependent on how many other transactions are currently waiting to be processed on the base layer as a whole. The [average fee](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_average_transaction_fee) in January 2021 was $0.63, and $28.60 in April 2021.

</div>

## Review & approval

<div class="center" markdown="1">

{% include image.html
   image = "/assets/images/guide/payments/send/confirm.png"
   retina = "/assets/images/guide/payments/send/confirm@2x.png"
   alt-text = "Invoice approval screen"
   caption = "A compact summary to confirm the information is accurate."
   width = 250
   height = 541
   layout = "float-right-desktop -background -shadow"
%}

Particularly with payments for larger amounts, it is good practice to allow users to review and confirm the information before it is sent.

Payments initiated via invoices which don't require any additional input by the user can avoid this review step, as the whole user interaction is one of review and confirmation.

Wallets that offer features for [spending limits]({{ '/guide/onboarding/protecting-a-wallet/#wallet-limits' | relative_url }}) or support [multi-key]({{ '/guide/private-key-management/multi-key/' | relative_url }}) schemes for additional security may ask users to go through additional confirmation steps here.

</div>

## Transaction processing

Processing times may also differ between on-chain and Lightning network payments. On-chain, pending transactions are bundled into a [new block]({{ '/guide/getting-started/technology-primer/#what-is-a-blockchain' | relative_url }}) roughly every 10 minutes. On the Lightning network, [payment routing]({{ '/guide/getting-started/technology-primer/#how-are-payments-routed' | relative_url }}) happens instantly and is largely dependent on the number of nodes involved, as well as their liquidity and processing speeds.

When transactions take longer than expected, users need to be clearly informed about the status. In scenarios like in-store payments, speedy confirmation is of the essence, as the user wants to move on, and the merchant may have other customers waiting. In-app status updates can be coupled with notifications to ensure that both parties are confident that everything is in order. For a framework on timing, see [this article on response time limits](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/response-times-3-important-limits/).

{% include image-gallery.html pages = page.imagesProcessing %}

In case a user needs to briefly wait, the application should not block the interface, but offer other useful actions to perform, such as labelling and tagging the payment, or adding the recipient to the contact list.

On-chain, you may offer users the options to cancel (via [replace-by-fee](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/replace-by-fee/) (RBF)) or speed-up (via [child-pays-for-parent](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/cpfp/) (CPFP)) a transaction. This is only possible after the transaction has been broadcast, but before it has been included in a block.

## Success

<div class="center" markdown="1">

{% include image.html
   image = "/assets/images/guide/payments/send/success.png"
   retina = "/assets/images/guide/payments/send/success@2x.png"
   alt-text = "Screen showing a completed transaction"
   caption = "A brief transaction summary with access to further details."
   width = 250
   height = 541
   layout = "float-right-desktop -background -shadow"
%}

Completion of a payment should be clearly indicated to the user.

It should also be simple to share a proof that the payment was made. In-person, it may suffice to show the screen to the receiver. Additional options like sharing the confirmation via chat or email may also be useful.

As on-chain transactions can be globally verified by anyone, a link to a [bitcoin explorer]({{ '/guide/getting-started/software/#explorers' | relative_url }}) can be shared as a payment confirmation. For Lightning transactions, the so-called `preimage` can be considered a proof of payment.

</div>

## Errors

Handling problems gracefully is particularly important when it comes to payments, as users may be concerned about having lost funds. Clear communication may include:
- A brief explanation of what went wrong
- Status of the funds and payment to address user worries
- How the problem can be fixed or avoided
- What to do next

{% include image-gallery.html pages = page.imagesErrors %}

It is ideal when the application can automatically identify and fix or avoid the problem. This may not always be possible, or even wanted, if the solution incurs extra fees or takes time. For practical purposes, it can be helpful to group problems into categories, such as:

- The problem cannot be identified
- The problem can be identified and requires manual action by the user
- The problem can be automatically fixed, but the user needs to choose which solution to use
- The app can likely automatically fix the problem with negligible impact on the user

Effectively supporting users when problems occur can build trust and confidence, and essential aspect for financial applications.

## Advanced options

There are situations in which users may want to make more complex adjustments to the payment.

**Coin selection**

Some users may prefer to choose which of their bitcoin (UTXOs to be precise) to send, in order to protect their privacy. More on this topic on the [Coin selection page]({{ '/guide/glossary/coin-selection/' | relative_url }}) page.

**Lightning routing options**

Routing is a probabilistic endeavor. For example, a routing algorithm may identify two routes. The first one has a low fee but is also less likely to succeed. The second route has a higher fee, but is more likely to succeed. Due to the technical complexity and unknowns, there is [ongoing conversation](https://github.com/BitcoinDesign/Guide/issues/585) whether routing options are relevant for users to be aware of and make decisions on.

Next, we cover [privacy considerations]({{ '/guide/payments/privacy' | relative_url }}) when to consider when making bitcoin payments.

   previousUrl = "/guide/payments/request/payment-request-formats"
   previousName = "Requesting bitcoin"
   nextUrl = "/guide/payments/privacy/"
   nextName = "Payments privacy"
