# Requesting bitcoin

To request bitcoin, the receiver must provide the sender with a payment request. Several payment request formats are available, both with bitcoin and Lightning, each having its unique use cases and trade-offs. Payment requests can be single-use or reusable. This page covers the design considerations around generating, presenting, and sharing payment requests as well as receiving bitcoin.

## Requesting entry points

When a user needs to request bitcoin, there are several ways in which this can be initiated including:

- Generating single-use payment requests
- Using reusable payment requests
- Importing a withdraw request

Below is an overview of these various entry points:

%}

</div>

## Single-use payment requests

The most common way bitcoin is requested today is in the form of single-use payment requests. For Lightning, a standard [BOLT11](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/blob/master/11-payment-encoding.md) invoice is used. For on-chain, [addresses of various types]({{ "/guide/glossary/address/" | relative_url }}) are used. Addresses can be reused though this is not advised due to [privacy concerns]({{ "/guide/payments/privacy/#generate-a-new-address-for-each-payment" | relative_url }}). Single-use invoices and addresses need to be easily and conveniently generated within a wallet application.

### Amount

When generating a single-use payment request, the receiver may want to add an amount to be paid. Entering an amount from the home screen can speed up the requesting flow. Alternatively, users can add an amount to an already generated payment request. Entering an amount needs to be clear to prevent users entering incorrect amounts.

Amount units need to be toggleable between bitcoin, satoshi and local currency values as senders may request in a set unit. Ensure the unit being entered is prominent to prevent entering of the wrong unit amount. More on the [Units & Symbols page]({{ "/guide/payments/units-and-symbols/" | relative_url }}).

### Address types

There are several address types that can be used for on-chain payment requests. Each address type has unique benefits, such as SegWit saving on network fees. It's recommended to encourage users to use the latest - more feature rich address types. However, older address types should be supported for seamless backwards compatibility. More on the [address types]({{ "/guide/glossary/address/" | relative_url }}) page.

### Meta data

A payment request with only standard data like an amount and date communicates little to both parties about the payment. Users should have the option to attach a note for record-keeping and for the sender to read. Adding tags, labels and any other metadata that may be relevant to give more context to the payment is also beneficial.

#### Invoice expirations

A piece of meta data unique to invoices is an expiration time. This is how long until a single-use invoice expires. By default this is 60 minutes. When an invoice is generated an expiration timer needs to be shown to users alongside the payment request. For more custom use cases, allow users to adjust this expiration time manually.

%}

</div>

## Reusable payment requests

Reusable payment requests aren’t as widely adopted or used as their single-use counterparts. For some use cases, reusable payment requests offer an improved user experience, more flexibility, and enable unique use cases compared to single-use payment requests. Reusable payment requests avoids users from having to manually initiate a payment request each time they need to receive bitcoin, greatly simplifying payment flows.

Reusable payment requests are common when making Lightning payments as they are made more frequently. So manually generating a Lightning payment request for each payment adds a lot of friction.

[Lightning addresses](https://lightningaddress.com/), which look like regular emails (jane@domain.com), are a popular reusable way in which users can request Lightning payments. Receiving to a Lightning address requires users to generate their own unique Lightning address that can be shared with senders. These are not native to the Lightning network itself but rather use a third party server, often ran by the wallet provider, to provide this service. Generating a Lightning address is often done within the users profile or during onboarding.

Reusable payment requests are not common when conducting transactions. This is due to them being conducted less frequently so the burden of generating a new payment request for each on-chain payment is not as large. On-chain addresses are reusable, though as previously mentioned this has privacy implications so this practice is not recommended.

Several, not widely supported, reusable payments request formats also exist. For Lightning, there are BOLT 12 offers, AMP invoices and Keysends, which require just a node ID. For on-chain, there are reusable payment codes [BIP 47](https://bips.xyz/47) and [xpubs]({{ "/guide/glossary/#extended-public-key-xpub-ypub-zpub" | relative_url }}), which can be used to generate addresses for receiving bitcoin on-chain. Learn more about these on our [payment request formats]({{ "/guide/payments/request/payment-request-formats/" | relative_url }}) page.

### Contact cards

Contact cards are a great way to  store, manage and share reusable payment requests. A user's own contact card can save and share the users own reusable payment requests. Contact cards of other users can store their reusable payment requests shared with the user. This greatly simplifies both requesting and [sending]({{ "/guide/payments/send/" | relative_url }}) flows.

</div>

## Withdrawal request

Another way a user can request bitcoin is from a withdrawal request. A withdrawal request is a payment request that lets the receiver withdraw bitcoin from another wallet. Unlike previously mentioned payment requests, withdrawal requests are generated by the sender. These can be useful for merchants providing refunds to customers.

We explore generating a withdrawal request in our [sending bitcoin]({{ "/guide/payments/send/" | relative_url }}) section. Wallets that do not support withdrawal requests should provide users with a human readable error if an attempt is made to use one. Our [payments format page]({{ "/guide/payments/request/payment-request-formats/" | relative_url }}) goes into more detail on withdrawal requests.

<div class="image-slide-gallery">

   image = "/assets/images/guide/payments/request/withdrawal-qr.png"

   caption = "With withdrawal requests the user is “pulling” bitcoin from another users wallet."
   alt-text = "Screen showing withdraw request UI."
   width = 250
   height = 541
%}

</div>

The more payment request formats a wallet supports generating and receiving to, the more interoperable it will be. Some wallets may not support sending to a particular format so having several options makes it easier to request bitcoin.

## Sharing payment requests

Once a user has generated a payment request the next action to take is sharing it with the sender. There are several ways in which this can be done. Supporting all methods of sharing across payment formats makes it easier for users to request bitcoin.

### Plaintext

Sharing a payment request as plaintext involves simply copying and sharing it with a sender. It is typical for bitcoin wallets to provide a share button that allows receivers to share a payment request in this manner conveniently. Both reusable and single-use requests should be shareable as plaintext.

### Payment link

Bitcoin payment links are hypertext that contain a bitcoin payment request. They often contain a URI, **bitcoin:** for an on-chain and **lightning:** for Lightning, so they can be identified by the device clicking them. Other data is also usually included in these payment links alongside the request such as a note or label.

### QR code

QR codes are a common way to present payment requests to senders. Any type of payment request can be converted into a QR for sharing with a sender. When generating QR codes in a wallet application, ensure they are large enough and have high contrast with the application's background to be easily scanned.

Typically, QR codes are downloadable. For single-use requests, this makes them easier to share over various mediums. For reusable requests, these QR codes can be displayed in places where payments must be regularly sent, like a website's donation page.

{% include /tip/open.html label="Uppercase QR code data" icon="info" color="blue" %}

Using uppercased payment requests in QR codes results in less complex, more easily scannable, QR codes.

{% include /tip/close.html %}

### Contactless

A contactless share uses near field communication (NFC) technology to share a payment request with a nearby physical device. This is a convenient way to share a payment request in-person.

</div>

## Receiving a payment

Once a request has been shared, the sender then needs to send bitcoin to the request. We cover the design considerations and user flows for sending bitcoin in our [sending bitcoin]({{ "/guide/payments/send/" | relative_url }}) page.

### Lightning

Receiving a payment is something that involves a lot of background complexity. How a wallet application manages this, has a major impact on the end user's experience.

To receive a payment, the receiver needs a payment channel with inbound liquidity and also has to be online. Some wallets offer services that allow channels to be opened on-demand if a user has no inbound liquidity when receiving an incoming payment. They may also hold payments for a user until they are online to forward it to them. These services require a wallet to be solely connected to the peer that offers these services. We cover what services are commonly offered and how they work on our Lightning services page.

Without Lightning services, a user will need to obtain some inbound liquidity before receiving a payment. This can be done by opening a channel with a peer that offers inbound liquidity and/or sending payments moving outbound to inbound capacity. It is recommended to let users know if they do not have any inbound liquidity before they share a payment request to prevent a payment failure.

<div class="image-slide-gallery">

{% include picture.html
   image = "/assets/images/guide/onboarding/funding-a-wallet/opening-channel.png"
   retina = "/assets/images/guide/onboarding/funding-a-wallet/opening-channel@2x.png.png"
   layout = "shadow"

   image = "/assets/images/guide/onboarding/funding-a-wallet/channel-opened.png"
   retina = "/assets/images/guide/onboarding/funding-a-wallet/channel-opened@2x.png"
   layout = "shadow"
   caption = "Indicate to users that, if they have no inbound liquidity, they should get some before requesting a payment."
   alt-text = "Screen showing that inbound liquidity is required."
   width = 250
   height = 541
%}

{% include picture.html
   image = "/assets/images/guide/onboarding/funding-a-wallet/no-inbound.png"
   retina = "/assets/images/guide/onboarding/funding-a-wallet/no-inbound@2x.png"
   layout = "shadow"
   caption = "Guide users as to how to obtain inbound liquidity so they can receive payments."
   alt-text = "Screen showing options to receive inbound liquidity."
   width = 250
   height = 541
%}

</div>

### On-chain

Receiving on-chain involves the sender broadcasting a transaction to the network for it to be confirmed.

<div class="center" markdown="1">

{% include picture.html
   image = "/assets/images/guide/payments/request/confirming.png"
   retina = "/assets/images/guide/payments/request/confirming@2x.png"
   layout = "float-left-desktop -background -shadow"
   caption = "For on-chain, keep users updated on incoming pending transactions."
   alt-text = "Screen showing on-chain transaction being confirmed."
   width = 250
   height = 541
%}

As on-chain transaction confirmation times vary based on network congestion and fees being paid, it is uncertain exactly when a on-chain payment will be considered complete. Keep users informed of the state of their incoming transactions.

</div>

## Success

Wallet applications should clearly indicate once a payment has been received by the user.

<div class="center" markdown="1">

{% include image.html
   image = "/assets/images/guide/payments/request/received.png"
   retina = "/assets/images/guide/payments/request/received@2x.png"
   width = 250
   height = 541
   caption = "Notify the user once their incoming payment is complete."
   alt-text = "Screen showing a payment has been received."
   layout = "float-right-desktop -background -shadow"
%}

Users should have the option to share a confirmation that the payment has been received with the sender. For on-chain, the confirmed transaction on a bitcoin block explorer can be shared. For Lightning, a preimage can be shared to show proof of payment.

For in-person payments, showing the confirmation screen to the sender will likely suffice.
