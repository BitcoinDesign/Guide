# Payments and transactions

At its core, the bitcoin protocol enables transactions between people without middlemen, regardless of where in the world they are. 

This chapter is meant to give an overview of bitcoin transactions, including sending, receiving and transaction privacy with advice and best practices. After this chapter, you should be able to design payment solutions that are well suited to your productâ€™s use case, and understand best-practices for the implementation of it.

We have already established that [Bitcoin is money](https://bitcoin.design/guide/getting-started/why-bitcoin-is-unique/#its-money-but-digital), so let's dive into how it can be used to facilitate payments.
