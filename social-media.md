# Bitcoin Design on social media

We have Twitter and [Nostr](https://nostr-resources.com/) accounts for the Bitcoin Design Community at [@bitcoin_design](https://twitter.com/bitcoin_design) and [@bitcoin.design](nostr:npub13s5mxgws70rpxsug96jfvglggackjrxs2ehypwg0prjaxsek42sqd9l03e) (link only works if you have a Nostr client installed) respectively. We highlight project activity, design work and discussions from the community, announce [newsletter]({{ '/newsletter/' | relative_url }}) releases and host our [community calls](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpV0KfVOMoja_zmmFNSJXREVKE4PSU0M1) via Twitter Spaces.

## Format

These are our current writing guidelines for social media.

##### Voice, tone & writing style

- FOR things, promote solutions, use positive language
- Not AGAINST things, don’t use negative language
- Inform & educate
- High signal-to-noise ratio
- Friendly & approachable
- Succinct
- Use threads with each post capturing one idea/point

##### Content ideas

- Guide highlights: When new content is added to the guide, create a new thread on the additions (or re-post the authors threads - probably better)
- Designer spotlight: Highlight a designer in the community and share a short story about them / why they like bitcoin / what they work on etc.
- Announce calls and call recordings (learning bitcoin & design, design review, community call…)
- Quick user research and polls for community projects
- Respond to current design-related conversations (e.g. post a link to the Units & Symbols page if there’s a thread somewhere around unit formatting)
- Add context to posts when re-posting them, to add value

##### Do

- OK to highlight when products, services, and brands adopt strategies from the Guide, or do things that’s good for open source bitcoin or open design processes

##### Don't

- Criticize projects or people (if you must, use your personal accounts)
- Promote a specific product over others (if you must, use your personal accounts)

##### Good examples

- ABC Wallet just launched a new version with an improved UI. It's a perfect example of techniques from the Onboarding section of the Guide!
- Just wrapped up another awesome design sprint with XYZ Wallet. Thanks for being so open to collaboration with the Bitcoin Design Community!
- Several members of the Design Community participated in this podcast about DEF Wallet to talk about Lightning backups. What do you think about this topic?
- MNO Exchange just launched an initiative to provide grant funding to people working on open source bitcoin projects. Calling all designers!

##### Bad examples

- GHI Wallet has a pretty bad UI. Shame they haven't read the Guide.
- Gee, JKL Wallet, would it kill you to join a Design Review call?
- PQR Wallet is the best. You should all download it now!
- STU Wallet has a promotion going on where you can get free sats for downloading their app.
