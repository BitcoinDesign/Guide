# Projects

We don't just chat about design. We also actively improve design in the bitcoin ecosystem. Projects launched by community members often focus on creating design resources.

With collaborations, some of us try to help other bitcoin projects improve their products' design and user experience. For more details, see our [Collaboration](https://github.com/BitcoinDesign/Meta/blob/master/Collaboration.md) and [Project](https://github.com/BitcoinDesign/Meta/blob/master/Projects.md) documents. If you are interested in getting involved, reach out directly to the projects below, or reach out in our [Discord]({{ site.discord_invite_url }}).

## Community projects

These are some of the design projects we have initiated ourselves.

<div class="project-grid">
  {% for item in page.projects %}
    <div class="project-grid-item">
      <a class="project-grid-item-image" href="{{- item.links[0].link -}}" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
        <img src="{{ item.image.url | relative_url }}" width="{{ item.image.width }}" height="{{ item.image.height }}" alt="" />
      </a>
      <h3>
        <a href="{{- item.links[0].link -}}" target="_blank" rel="noopener">{{- item.name -}}</a>
      </h3>
      <p>{{- item.description -}}</p>

#### Adding a project or collaboration

The Bitcoin Design Community is intentionally only loosely organized. This makes it difficult to define specific rules of what is a community effort and what isn't. Best approach is to get consensus by asking in the [#general](https://discord.com/channels/903125802726596648/956386942788980766) channel in Discord or opening an issue in the [meta repo](https://github.com/BitcoinDesign/Meta/issues) on Github.
