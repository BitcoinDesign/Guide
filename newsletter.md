## Contribute

We use the [#spread-the-word](https://bitcoindesign.slack.com/archives/C01PRLDBCBA) channel in Slack to coordinate around the newsletter. We keep a draft document ([template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P8PRgcHgLiriieGZr33P1YLbIBigXBg9rXj42B1TXnQ/edit?usp=sharing)) around with public editing rights that everyone can add content to. A few days before publishing, the editors review the draft and start working on the final version. Note that it is up to the discretion of the editors to decide what will be posted.

Once posted, the newsletter is shared in [#general](https://bitcoindesign.slack.com/archives/C014J9ZKXB4) and on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bitcoin_design). We also discuss the content in more detail in our [community calls](https://github.com/BitcoinDesign/Meta/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+%22community+call%22) ([example recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPYQKgrjoj0)), which are scheduled the same day of the newsletter release.

The newsletter is currently managed by [Mo](https://twitter.com/MogashniNaidoo) and [Christoph](https://twitter.com/GBKS). Anyone is welcome to join. Shout-out to previous editors [Johns](https://twitter.com/johnsBeharry) and [Conor](https://twitter.com/ConorOkus) for their contributions.

We are always open to feedback and ideas to make the newsletter more useful and impactful.

## Format

The newsletter is structured like a series of bullet lists, organized into different types of content, as follows:

- Community - calls, current events, member activity
- Bitcoin design guide - update on ongoing work on the guide
- Seeking feedback - give visibility to members who are looking for input
- Everything else - external activity that relates to the community

Within each category, we use bullet lists to briefly summarize each item. Each point should be short and to the point. Light editorializing is OK.

The top of each edition starts with an image that serves as a visual summary of the text content. The image is split into a grid of 8 units, each one showing a screenshot or other visual of a bullet item.

The newsletter is hosted via [Substack](https://substack.com).
