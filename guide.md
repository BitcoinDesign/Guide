# The bitcoin design guide

**Bitcoin is a global payment protocol that anyone with Internet access can participate in and contribute to. However, because bitcoin’s use cases are as vast as its user base, building bitcoin applications can be complicated.**

We designed this guide to help anyone navigate those complexities—regardless of where they live or work. We can’t imagine every possible use case, but we can help you build for them.
