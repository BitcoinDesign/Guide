### Private key

Every bitcoin address has a public key and a corresponding private key, together they are called a keypair. If you have access to both the public and private key, you effectively control the funds in the address. As with HD Wallets there are also keypairs that control *branches* in the hierarchical tree of the wallet, and at the very top is the extended keypair (x-pub and x-prv for short) that control all the addresses in the wallet.

The private key is a 64 hexadecimal (or 256 if described in binary 1’s and 0’s) character string generated by the encryption algorithm. They look something like this in hexadecimal form:

`5KYZdUEo39z3FPrtuX2QbbwGnNP5zTd7yyr2SC1j299sBCnWjss`

Or for the extended private key:
