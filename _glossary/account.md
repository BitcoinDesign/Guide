title: Account
---

Just like wallet, the term account can also be used for very different things. In bitcoin wallets that follow the hierarchy described in [BIP44](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki), a bitcoin wallet can have multiple accounts, with each one having its own addresses. However, account is also oftentimes used for accounts with third-party service providers.

Differentiate between

- Bitcoin wallet account
- Service account
