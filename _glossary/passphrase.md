###  Passphrase
A passphrase can be added to the [recovery phrase](#recovery-phrase) for extra security. 
Technically, all recovery phrases have a pass phrase. If it’s not set by the user, an empty string (“”) will be used by default. Using the recovery phrase with or without the user-defined pass phrase will recover two DIFFERENT wallets. Pass phrases are sometimes referred to as the password, the extra word, or the 13th/25th word.
