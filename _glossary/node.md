### Node

Node refers to [software]({{ '/guide/getting-started/software/#nodes' | relative_url }}) that participates in the bitcoin network. It exchanges transaction data with other nodes, stores some or all of it, and verifies that transactions are valid. There is also dedicated [node hardware]({{ '/guide/getting-started/hardware/#hardware-wallets' | relative_url }}).

#### Full node

A node that fully verifies all transactions and rules of the Bitcoin network.

#### Pruned full node

A node that fully verifies all of the rules of the Bitcoin network with a much smaller storage capacity because it only stores transactions relevant to the users wallet.

#### Archival node

A full node that has not only verified all data, but also stores and provides it to other nodes on the network.
