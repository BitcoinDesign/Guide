A type of [CoinJoin](#coinjoin) for direct transactions between two parties that makes it harder to understand the ownership of the inputs included in the transaction. The sender creates a partial transaction that the recipient adds another input to. Then the sender broadcasts the transaction. The same amount of bitcoin is transferred as in a simple bitcoin transaction. However, the additional input from the recipient makes it harder to analyze from the outside what happened in the transaction.
