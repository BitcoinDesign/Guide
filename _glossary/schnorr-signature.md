title: Schnorr signature
---

An algorithm to generate cryptographic signatures. One of the benefits is that the size of multi signature transactions can be reduced, resulting in lower fees, and that multisignature transactions will appear equal to single signature, increasing privacy (see [MuSig](#musig)). The code for this improvement was merged in Bitcoin Core in September 2020.
