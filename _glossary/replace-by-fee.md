### Replace-by-fee (RBF)

A node policy that allows an unconfirmed transaction to be replaced with a different transaction that spends at least one of the same inputs and which pays a higher transaction fee. This can sometimes be useful if a transaction has got *stuck* during times of higher-than-normal network-fees.
