### Multi-signature wallet (Multisig)

Multi-signature wallets are bitcoin wallets that are controlled by more than one keypair. They can be defined by bitcoin scripts and use P2SH addresses. Common usecases and setups include *2-of-3*, or *3-of-5* multi-signature wallets that require a subset of the controlling keypairs to sign a transaction.
